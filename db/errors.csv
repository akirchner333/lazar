1,1,2,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE I. A hall in the Duke’s palace."
1,1,3,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Duke, Egeon, Jailer, Officers and other Attendants."
1,1,4,EGEON,"Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,"
1,1,5,EGEON,"And by the doom of death end woes and all."
1,1,6,DUKE,"Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more."
1,1,7,DUKE,"I am not partial to infringe our laws."
1,1,8,DUKE,"The enmity and discord which of late"
1,1,9,DUKE,"Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke"
1,1,10,DUKE,"To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,"
1,1,11,DUKE,"Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,"
1,1,12,DUKE,"Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,"
1,1,13,DUKE,"Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks."
1,1,14,DUKE,"For since the mortal and intestine jars"
1,1,15,DUKE,"’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,"
1,1,16,DUKE,"It hath in solemn synods been decreed,"
1,1,17,DUKE,"Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,"
1,1,18,DUKE,"To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;"
1,1,19,DUKE,"Nay more, if any born at Ephesus"
1,1,20,DUKE,"Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;"
1,1,21,DUKE,"Again, if any Syracusian born"
1,1,22,DUKE,"Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,"
1,1,23,DUKE,"His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,"
1,1,24,DUKE,"Unless a thousand marks be levied"
1,1,25,DUKE,"To quit the penalty and to ransom him."
1,1,26,DUKE,"Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,"
1,1,27,DUKE,"Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;"
1,1,28,DUKE,"Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die."
1,1,29,EGEON,"Yet this my comfort; when your words are done,"
1,1,30,EGEON,"My woes end likewise with the evening sun."
1,1,31,DUKE,"Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause"
1,1,32,DUKE,"Why thou departedst from thy native home,"
1,1,33,DUKE,"And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus."
1,1,34,EGEON,"A heavier task could not have been impos’d"
1,1,35,EGEON,"Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;"
1,1,36,EGEON,"Yet, that the world may witness that my end"
1,1,37,EGEON,"Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,"
1,1,38,EGEON,"I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave."
1,1,39,EGEON,"In Syracusa was I born, and wed"
1,1,40,EGEON,"Unto a woman happy but for me,"
1,1,41,EGEON,"And by me, had not our hap been bad."
1,1,42,EGEON,"With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d"
1,1,43,EGEON,"By prosperous voyages I often made"
1,1,44,EGEON,"To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death,"
1,1,45,EGEON,"And the great care of goods at random left,"
1,1,46,EGEON,"Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;"
1,1,47,EGEON,"From whom my absence was not six months old"
1,1,48,EGEON,"Before herself (almost at fainting under"
1,1,49,EGEON,"The pleasing punishment that women bear)"
1,1,50,EGEON,"Had made provision for her following me,"
1,1,51,EGEON,"And soon and safe arrived where I was."
1,1,52,EGEON,"There had she not been long but she became"
1,1,53,EGEON,"A joyful mother of two goodly sons,"
1,1,54,EGEON,"And, which was strange, the one so like the other"
1,1,55,EGEON,"As could not be distinguish’d but by names."
1,1,56,EGEON,"That very hour, and in the self-same inn,"
1,1,57,EGEON,"A mean woman was delivered"
1,1,58,EGEON,"Of such a burden, male twins, both alike."
1,1,59,EGEON,"Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,"
1,1,60,EGEON,"I bought, and brought up to attend my sons."
1,1,61,EGEON,"My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,"
1,1,62,EGEON,"Made daily motions for our home return."
1,1,63,EGEON,"Unwilling I agreed; alas, too soon"
1,1,64,EGEON,"We came aboard."
1,1,65,EGEON,"A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d"
1,1,66,EGEON,"Before the always-wind-obeying deep"
1,1,67,EGEON,"Gave any tragic instance of our harm;"
1,1,68,EGEON,"But longer did we not retain much hope;"
1,1,69,EGEON,"For what obscured light the heavens did grant"
1,1,70,EGEON,"Did but convey unto our fearful minds"
1,1,71,EGEON,"A doubtful warrant of immediate death,"
1,1,72,EGEON,"Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,"
1,1,73,EGEON,"Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,"
1,1,74,EGEON,"Weeping before for what she saw must come,"
1,1,75,EGEON,"And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,"
1,1,76,EGEON,"That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,"
1,1,77,EGEON,"Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me."
1,1,78,EGEON,"And this it was (for other means was none)."
1,1,79,EGEON,"The sailors sought for safety by our boat,"
1,1,80,EGEON,"And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us."
1,1,81,EGEON,"My wife, more careful for the latter-born,"
1,1,82,EGEON,"Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,"
1,1,83,EGEON,"Such as sea-faring men provide for storms."
1,1,84,EGEON,"To him one of the other twins was bound,"
1,1,85,EGEON,"Whilst I had been like heedful of the other."
1,1,86,EGEON,"The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,"
1,1,87,EGEON,"Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,"
1,1,88,EGEON,"Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,"
1,1,89,EGEON,"And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,"
1,1,90,EGEON,"Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought."
1,1,91,EGEON,"At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,"
1,1,92,EGEON,"Dispers’d those vapours that offended us,"
1,1,93,EGEON,"And by the benefit of his wished light"
1,1,94,EGEON,"The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered"
1,1,95,EGEON,"Two ships from far, making amain to us,"
1,1,96,EGEON,"Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this."
1,1,97,EGEON,"But ere they came—O, let me say no more!"
1,1,98,EGEON,"Gather the sequel by that went before."
1,1,99,DUKE,"Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,"
1,1,100,DUKE,"For we may pity, though not pardon thee."
1,1,101,EGEON,"O, had the gods done so, I had not now"
1,1,102,EGEON,"Worthily term’d them merciless to us."
1,1,103,EGEON,"For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,"
1,1,104,EGEON,"We were encountered by a mighty rock,"
1,1,105,EGEON,"Which being violently borne upon,"
1,1,106,EGEON,"Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;"
1,1,107,EGEON,"So that, in this unjust divorce of us,"
1,1,108,EGEON,"Fortune had left to both of us alike"
1,1,109,EGEON,"What to delight in, what to sorrow for."
1,1,110,EGEON,"Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened"
1,1,111,EGEON,"With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,"
1,1,112,EGEON,"Was carried with more speed before the wind,"
1,1,113,EGEON,"And in our sight they three were taken up"
1,1,114,EGEON,"By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought."
1,1,115,EGEON,"At length another ship had seiz’d on us;"
1,1,116,EGEON,"And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,"
1,1,117,EGEON,"Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack’d guests,"
1,1,118,EGEON,"And would have reft the fishers of their prey,"
1,1,119,EGEON,"Had not their bark been very slow of sail;"
1,1,120,EGEON,"And therefore homeward did they bend their course."
1,1,121,EGEON,"Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,"
1,1,122,EGEON,"That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d"
1,1,123,EGEON,"To tell sad stories of my own mishaps."
1,1,124,DUKE,"And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,"
1,1,125,DUKE,"Do me the favour to dilate at full"
1,1,126,DUKE,"What have befall’n of them and thee till now."
1,1,127,EGEON,"My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,"
1,1,128,EGEON,"At eighteen years became inquisitive"
1,1,129,EGEON,"After his brother, and importun’d me"
1,1,130,EGEON,"That his attendant, so his case was like,"
1,1,131,EGEON,"Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name,"
1,1,132,EGEON,"Might bear him company in the quest of him;"
1,1,133,EGEON,"Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,"
1,1,134,EGEON,"I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d."
1,1,135,EGEON,"Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,"
1,1,136,EGEON,"Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,"
1,1,137,EGEON,"And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,"
1,1,138,EGEON,"Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought"
1,1,139,EGEON,"Or that or any place that harbours men."
1,1,140,EGEON,"But here must end the story of my life;"
1,1,141,EGEON,"And happy were I in my timely death,"
1,1,142,EGEON,"Could all my travels warrant me they live."
1,1,143,DUKE,"Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d"
1,1,144,DUKE,"To bear the extremity of dire mishap;"
1,1,145,DUKE,"Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,"
1,1,146,DUKE,"Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,"
1,1,147,DUKE,"Which princes, would they, may not disannul,"
1,1,148,DUKE,"My soul should sue as advocate for thee."
1,1,149,DUKE,"But though thou art adjudged to the death,"
1,1,150,DUKE,"And passed sentence may not be recall’d"
1,1,151,DUKE,"But to our honour’s great disparagement,"
1,1,152,DUKE,"Yet will I favour thee in what I can."
1,1,153,DUKE,"Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day"
1,1,154,DUKE,"To seek thy health by beneficial help."
1,1,155,DUKE,"Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;"
1,1,156,DUKE,"Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,"
1,1,157,DUKE,"And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die."
1,1,158,DUKE,"Jailer, take him to thy custody."
1,1,159,JAILER,"I will, my lord."
1,1,160,EGEON,"Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,"
1,1,161,EGEON,"But to procrastinate his lifeless end."

2,1,325,ADRIANA,"Say, didst thou speak with him? know’st thou his mind?"
2,1,326,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear."
2,1,327,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it."
2,1,328,LUCIANA,"Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?"
2,1,329,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows; and withal"
2,1,330,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them."
2,1,331,ADRIANA,"But say, I prithee, is he coming home?"
2,1,332,ADRIANA,"It seems he hath great care to please his wife."
2,1,333,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad."
2,1,334,ADRIANA,"Horn-mad, thou villain?"
2,1,335,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I mean not cuckold-mad,"
2,1,336,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But sure he’s stark mad."
2,1,337,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"When I desir’d him to come home to dinner,"
2,1,338,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"He ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold."
2,1,339,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“’Tis dinner time,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he."
2,1,340,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“Your meat doth burn” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he."
2,1,341,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“Will you come home?” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he."
2,1,342,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?”"
2,1,343,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“The pig” quoth I “is burn’d”. “My gold,” quoth he."
2,1,344,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“My mistress, sir,” quoth I. “Hang up thy mistress;"

2,1,346,LUCIANA,"Quoth who?"
2,1,347,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Quoth my master."
2,1,348,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.”"
2,1,349,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"So that my errand, due unto my tongue,"
2,1,350,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;"
2,1,351,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For, in conclusion, he did beat me there."
2,1,352,ADRIANA,"Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home."
2,1,353,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Go back again, and be new beaten home?"
2,1,354,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For God’s sake, send some other messenger."
2,1,355,ADRIANA,"Back slave, or I will break thy pate across."
2,1,356,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And he will bless that cross with other beating."
2,1,357,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Between you I shall have a holy head."
2,1,358,ADRIANA,"Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home."
2,1,359,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Am I so round with you, as you with me,"
2,1,360,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That like a football you do spurn me thus?"
2,1,361,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither."

2,1,387,ADRIANA,"I see the jewel best enamelled"

2,2,469,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"man."
2,2,470,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an"
2,2,471,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"excrement?"
2,2,472,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath"
2,2,473,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit."
2,2,474,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit."
2,2,475,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair."
2,2,476,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit."
2,2,477,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of"

2,2,490,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"nature."
2,2,491,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover."

2,2,563,ADRIANA,"Makes me with thy strength to communicate:"
2,2,564,ADRIANA,"If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,"

2,2,566,ADRIANA,"Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion"
2,2,567,ADRIANA,"Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion."
2,2,568,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme."
2,2,569,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What, was I married to her in my dream?"
2,2,570,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?"
2,2,571,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?"

2,2,595,ADRIANA,"Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,"
2,2,596,ADRIANA,"And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks."
2,2,597,ADRIANA,"Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,"
2,2,598,ADRIANA,"Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter."
2,2,599,ADRIANA,"Come, sister; Dromio, play the porter well."
2,2,600,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?"
2,2,601,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sleeping or waking, mad, or well-advis’d?"

2,2,604,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And in this mist at all adventures go."
2,2,605,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, shall I be porter at the gate?"
2,2,606,ADRIANA,"Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate."

3,1,610,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE I. The same."
3,1,611,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, his man Dromio of Ephesus, Angelo the"
3,1,612,STAGE DIRECTION," goldsmith and Balthasar the merchant."
3,1,613,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all,"
3,1,614,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours."
3,1,615,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Say that I linger’d with you at your shop"
3,1,616,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To see the making of her carcanet,"
3,1,617,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And that tomorrow you will bring it home."
3,1,618,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But here’s a villain that would face me down."
3,1,619,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,"
3,1,620,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And charg’d him with a thousand marks in gold,"
3,1,621,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And that I did deny my wife and house."
3,1,622,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?"
3,1,623,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know."
3,1,624,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;"
3,1,625,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,"
3,1,626,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Your own handwriting would tell you what I think."
3,1,627,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I think thou art an ass."
3,1,628,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Marry, so it doth appear"
3,1,629,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear."
3,1,630,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I should kick, being kick’d; and being at that pass,"
3,1,631,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass."
3,1,632,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You’re sad, Signior Balthasar; pray God our cheer"
3,1,633,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"May answer my good will and your good welcome here."
3,1,634,BALTHASAR,"I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear."
3,1,635,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"O, Signior Balthasar, either at flesh or fish"
3,1,636,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish."
3,1,637,BALTHASAR,"Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords."
3,1,638,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but words."
3,1,639,BALTHASAR,"Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast."
3,1,640,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest."
3,1,641,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;"
3,1,642,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart."
3,1,643,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But soft; my door is lock’d. Go bid them let us in."
3,1,644,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!"
3,1,645,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"[_Within._] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!"
3,1,646,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch:"
3,1,647,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call’st for such store"
3,1,648,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door."
3,1,649,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street."
3,1,650,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on’s feet."
3,1,651,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Who talks within there? Ho, open the door."
3,1,652,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you’ll tell me wherefore."
3,1,653,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Wherefore? For my dinner. I have not dined today."
3,1,654,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nor today here you must not; come again when you may."
3,1,655,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?"
3,1,656,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio."
3,1,657,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name;"
3,1,658,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle blame."
3,1,659,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,"
3,1,660,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Thou wouldst have chang’d thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass."
3,1,661,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Luce concealed from Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions."
3,1,662,LUCE,"[_Within._] What a coil is there, Dromio, who are those at the gate?"
3,1,663,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Let my master in, Luce."
3,1,664,LUCE,"Faith, no, he comes too late,"
3,1,665,LUCE,"And so tell your master."
3,1,666,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"O Lord, I must laugh;"
3,1,667,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Have at you with a proverb:—Shall I set in my staff?"
3,1,668,LUCE,"Have at you with another: that’s—When? can you tell?"
3,1,669,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"If thy name be called Luce,—Luce, thou hast answer’d him well."
3,1,670,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Do you hear, you minion? you’ll let us in, I hope?"
3,1,671,LUCE,"I thought to have ask’d you."
3,1,672,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"And you said no."
3,1,673,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"So, come, help. Well struck, there was blow for blow."
3,1,674,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Thou baggage, let me in."
3,1,675,LUCE,"Can you tell for whose sake?"
3,1,676,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Master, knock the door hard."
3,1,677,LUCE,"Let him knock till it ache."
3,1,678,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down."
3,1,679,LUCE,"What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?"
3,1,680,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Adriana concealed from Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions."
3,1,681,ADRIANA,"[_Within._] Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?"
3,1,682,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys."
3,1,683,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Are you there, wife? you might have come before."
3,1,684,ADRIANA,"Your wife, sir knave? go, get you from the door."
3,1,685,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore."
3,1,686,ANGELO,"Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would fain have either."
3,1,687,BALTHASAR,"In debating which was best, we shall part with neither."
3,1,688,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither."
3,1,689,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in."
3,1,690,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You would say so, master, if your garments were thin."
3,1,691,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold."
3,1,692,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold."
3,1,693,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Go, fetch me something, I’ll break ope the gate."
3,1,694,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s pate."
3,1,695,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind;"
3,1,696,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind."
3,1,697,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"It seems thou want’st breaking; out upon thee, hind!"
3,1,698,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Here’s too much “out upon thee”; I pray thee, let me in."
3,1,699,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin."
3,1,700,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Well, I’ll break in; go, borrow me a crow."
3,1,701,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"A crow without feather; master, mean you so?"
3,1,702,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather."
3,1,703,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow together."
3,1,704,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Go, get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow."
3,1,705,BALTHASAR,"Have patience, sir. O, let it not be so:"
3,1,706,BALTHASAR,"Herein you war against your reputation,"
3,1,707,BALTHASAR,"And draw within the compass of suspect"
3,1,708,BALTHASAR,"The unviolated honour of your wife."
3,1,709,BALTHASAR,"Once this,—your long experience of her wisdom,"
3,1,710,BALTHASAR,"Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,"
3,1,711,BALTHASAR,"Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;"
3,1,712,BALTHASAR,"And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse"
3,1,713,BALTHASAR,"Why at this time the doors are made against you."
3,1,714,BALTHASAR,"Be rul’d by me; depart in patience,"
3,1,715,BALTHASAR,"And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,"
3,1,716,BALTHASAR,"And about evening, come yourself alone"
3,1,717,BALTHASAR,"To know the reason of this strange restraint."
3,1,718,BALTHASAR,"If by strong hand you offer to break in"
3,1,719,BALTHASAR,"Now in the stirring passage of the day,"
3,1,720,BALTHASAR,"A vulgar comment will be made of it;"
3,1,721,BALTHASAR,"And that supposed by the common rout"
3,1,722,BALTHASAR,"Against your yet ungalled estimation"
3,1,723,BALTHASAR,"That may with foul intrusion enter in,"
3,1,724,BALTHASAR,"And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;"
3,1,725,BALTHASAR,"For slander lives upon succession,"
3,1,726,BALTHASAR,"For ever hous’d where it gets possession."
3,1,727,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You have prevail’d. I will depart in quiet,"
3,1,728,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry."
3,1,729,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I know a wench of excellent discourse,"
3,1,730,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;"
3,1,731,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There will we dine. This woman that I mean,"
3,1,732,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My wife (but, I protest, without desert)"
3,1,733,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;"
3,1,734,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To her will we to dinner.—Get you home"
3,1,735,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And fetch the chain, by this I know ’tis made."
3,1,736,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,"
3,1,737,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow"
3,1,738,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife)"
3,1,739,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste."
3,1,740,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,"
3,1,741,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me."
3,1,742,ANGELO,"I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence."
3,1,743,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense."

3,2,746,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse."
3,2,747,LUCIANA,"And may it be that you have quite forgot"
3,2,748,LUCIANA,"A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,"
3,2,749,LUCIANA,"Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?"
3,2,750,LUCIANA,"Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?"
3,2,751,LUCIANA,"If you did wed my sister for her wealth,"
3,2,752,LUCIANA,"Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness;"
3,2,753,LUCIANA,"Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,"
3,2,754,LUCIANA,"Muffle your false love with some show of blindness."
3,2,755,LUCIANA,"Let not my sister read it in your eye;"
3,2,756,LUCIANA,"Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;"
3,2,757,LUCIANA,"Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;"
3,2,758,LUCIANA,"Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger;"
3,2,759,LUCIANA,"Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted;"
3,2,760,LUCIANA,"Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint,"
3,2,761,LUCIANA,"Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?"
3,2,762,LUCIANA,"What simple thief brags of his own attaint?"
3,2,763,LUCIANA,"’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed"
3,2,764,LUCIANA,"And let her read it in thy looks at board."
3,2,765,LUCIANA,"Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;"
3,2,766,LUCIANA,"Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word."
3,2,767,LUCIANA,"Alas, poor women, make us but believe,"
3,2,768,LUCIANA,"Being compact of credit, that you love us."
3,2,769,LUCIANA,"Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;"
3,2,770,LUCIANA,"We in your motion turn, and you may move us."
3,2,771,LUCIANA,"Then, gentle brother, get you in again;"
3,2,772,LUCIANA,"Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife."
3,2,773,LUCIANA,"’Tis holy sport to be a little vain"
3,2,774,LUCIANA,"When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife."
3,2,775,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sweet mistress, what your name is else, I know not,"
3,2,776,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Nor by what wonder you do hit on mine;"
3,2,777,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not"
3,2,778,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine."
3,2,779,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;"
3,2,780,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,"
3,2,781,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Smother’d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,"
3,2,782,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"The folded meaning of your words’ deceit."
3,2,783,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you"
3,2,784,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"To make it wander in an unknown field?"
3,2,785,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Are you a god? would you create me new?"
3,2,786,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield."
3,2,787,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But if that I am I, then well I know"
3,2,788,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,"
3,2,789,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Nor to her bed no homage do I owe."
3,2,790,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Far more, far more, to you do I decline."
3,2,791,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note"
3,2,792,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears."
3,2,793,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;"
3,2,794,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,"
3,2,795,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And as a bed I’ll take thee, and there lie,"
3,2,796,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And, in that glorious supposition think"
3,2,797,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"He gains by death that hath such means to die."
3,2,798,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Let love, being light, be drowned if she sink!"
3,2,799,LUCIANA,"What, are you mad, that you do reason so?"
3,2,800,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know."
3,2,801,LUCIANA,"It is a fault that springeth from your eye."
3,2,802,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by."
3,2,803,LUCIANA,"Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight."
3,2,804,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night."
3,2,805,LUCIANA,"Why call you me love? Call my sister so."
3,2,806,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thy sister’s sister."
3,2,807,LUCIANA,"That’s my sister."
3,2,808,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"No,"
3,2,809,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"It is thyself, mine own self’s better part,"
3,2,810,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart,"
3,2,811,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim,"

3,2,813,LUCIANA,"All this my sister is, or else should be."

3,2,822,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, how now, Dromio? where runn’st thou so fast?"
3,2,823,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?"
3,2,824,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself."
3,2,825,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I am an ass, I am a woman’s man, and besides myself."
3,2,826,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What woman’s man? and how besides thyself?"
3,2,827,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman, one that claims me,"
3,2,828,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"one that haunts me, one that will have me."
3,2,829,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What claim lays she to thee?"
3,2,830,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would"
3,2,831,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"have me as a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me, but"
3,2,832,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me."
3,2,833,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What is she?"
3,2,834,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without"
3,2,835,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"he say “sir-reverence”. I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is"
3,2,836,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"she a wondrous fat marriage."
3,2,837,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"How dost thou mean a “fat marriage”?"
3,2,838,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know not"
3,2,839,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by"
3,2,840,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"her own light. I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a"
3,2,841,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer"
3,2,842,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"than the whole world."
3,2,843,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What complexion is she of?"
3,2,844,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept. For why?"
3,2,845,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"she sweats, a man may go overshoes in the grime of it."
3,2,846,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"That’s a fault that water will mend."
3,2,847,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it."
3,2,848,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What’s her name?"
3,2,849,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that’s an ell and three"
3,2,850,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip."
3,2,851,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Then she bears some breadth?"
3,2,852,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip. She is spherical,"
3,2,853,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"like a globe. I could find out countries in her."
3,2,854,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"In what part of her body stands Ireland?"
3,2,855,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by the bogs."
3,2,856,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where Scotland?"
3,2,857,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of the hand."
3,2,858,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where France?"
3,2,859,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war against her hair."
3,2,860,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where England?"
3,2,861,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them."
3,2,862,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between"
3,2,863,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"France and it."
3,2,864,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where Spain?"
3,2,865,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath."
3,2,866,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where America, the Indies?"
3,2,867,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"O, sir, upon her nose, all o’er-embellished with rubies, carbuncles,"
3,2,868,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who"
3,2,869,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"sent whole armadoes of carracks to be ballast at her nose."
3,2,870,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?"

4,1,954,ANGELO,"Saving your merry humour, here’s the note"
4,1,955,ANGELO,"How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,"
4,1,956,ANGELO,"The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,"

4,1,989,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I answer you? What should I answer you?"

4,2,1053,ADRIANA,"He meant he did me none; the more my spite."
4,2,1054,LUCIANA,"Then swore he that he was a stranger here."
4,2,1055,ADRIANA,"And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were."

4,2,1078,LUCIANA,"How hast thou lost thy breath?"
4,2,1079,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"By running fast."
4,2,1080,ADRIANA,"Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?"
4,2,1081,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell."
4,2,1082,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,"

4,2,1087,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;"
4,2,1088,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dryfoot well,"
4,2,1089,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"One that, before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell."
4,2,1090,ADRIANA,"Why, man, what is the matter?"

4,2,1101,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?"
4,2,1102,ADRIANA,"What, the chain?"
4,2,1103,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, no, the bell, ’tis time that I were gone."
4,2,1104,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one."
4,2,1105,ADRIANA,"The hours come back! That did I never hear."
4,2,1106,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, ’a turns back for very fear."
4,2,1107,ADRIANA,"As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason!"
4,2,1108,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he’s worth to season."
4,2,1109,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say"
4,2,1110,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"That time comes stealing on by night and day?"

4,3,1135,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?"
4,3,1136,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not that Adam that kept the paradise, but that Adam that keeps the"

4,3,1140,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I understand thee not."
4,3,1141,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No? Why, ’tis a plain case: he that went like a bass-viol in a case of"
4,3,1142,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a"
4,3,1143,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"sob, and ’rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives"
4,3,1144,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits"

4,3,1146,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What! thou mean’st an officer?"
4,3,1147,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it"

4,3,1168,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"damn me”, that’s as much to say, “God make me a light wench.” It is"
4,3,1169,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"written they appear to men like angels of light. Light is an effect of"

4,3,1185,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A nut, a cherry-stone; but she, more covetous,"
4,3,1186,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Would have a chain."
4,3,1187,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, be wise; and if you give it her,"

5,1,1431,ABBESS,"Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?"
5,1,1432,ABBESS,"Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye"
5,1,1433,ABBESS,"Stray’d his affection in unlawful love?"
5,1,1434,ABBESS,"A sin prevailing much in youthful men"
5,1,1435,ABBESS,"Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?"
5,1,1436,ABBESS,"Which of these sorrows is he subject to?"
5,1,1437,ADRIANA,"To none of these, except it be the last,"
5,1,1438,ADRIANA,"Namely, some love that drew him oft from home."
5,1,1439,ABBESS,"You should for that have reprehended him."
5,1,1440,ADRIANA,"Why, so I did."
5,1,1441,ABBESS,"Ay, but not rough enough."
5,1,1442,ADRIANA,"As roughly as my modesty would let me."
5,1,1443,ABBESS,"Haply in private."
5,1,1444,ADRIANA,"And in assemblies too."
5,1,1445,ABBESS,"Ay, but not enough."
5,1,1446,ADRIANA,"It was the copy of our conference."
5,1,1447,ADRIANA,"In bed he slept not for my urging it;"
5,1,1448,ADRIANA,"At board he fed not for my urging it;"
5,1,1449,ADRIANA,"Alone, it was the subject of my theme;"
5,1,1450,ADRIANA,"In company I often glanced it;"
5,1,1451,ADRIANA,"Still did I tell him it was vile and bad."
5,1,1452,ABBESS,"And thereof came it that the man was mad."
5,1,1453,ABBESS,"The venom clamours of a jealous woman"
5,1,1454,ABBESS,"Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth."
5,1,1455,ABBESS,"It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing,"
5,1,1456,ABBESS,"And thereof comes it that his head is light."
5,1,1457,ABBESS,"Thou say’st his meat was sauc’d with thy upbraidings."
5,1,1458,ABBESS,"Unquiet meals make ill digestions;"
5,1,1459,ABBESS,"Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,"
5,1,1460,ABBESS,"And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?"
5,1,1461,ABBESS,"Thou say’st his sports were hinder’d by thy brawls."
5,1,1462,ABBESS,"Sweet recreation barr’d, what doth ensue"
5,1,1463,ABBESS,"But moody and dull melancholy,"
5,1,1464,ABBESS,"Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,"
5,1,1465,ABBESS,"And at her heels a huge infectious troop"
5,1,1466,ABBESS,"Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?"
5,1,1467,ABBESS,"In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest"
5,1,1468,ABBESS,"To be disturb’d would mad or man or beast."
5,1,1469,ABBESS,"The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits"
5,1,1470,ABBESS,"Hath scar’d thy husband from the use of’s wits."
5,1,1471,LUCIANA,"She never reprehended him but mildly,"
5,1,1472,LUCIANA,"When he demean’d himself rough, rude, and wildly."
5,1,1473,LUCIANA,"Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?"
5,1,1474,ADRIANA,"She did betray me to my own reproof."
5,1,1475,ADRIANA,"Good people, enter and lay hold on him."
5,1,1476,ABBESS,"No, not a creature enters in my house."
5,1,1477,ADRIANA,"Then let your servants bring my husband forth."
5,1,1478,ABBESS,"Neither. He took this place for sanctuary,"
5,1,1479,ABBESS,"And it shall privilege him from your hands"
5,1,1480,ABBESS,"Till I have brought him to his wits again,"
5,1,1481,ABBESS,"Or lose my labour in assaying it."
5,1,1482,ADRIANA,"I will attend my husband, be his nurse,"
5,1,1483,ADRIANA,"Diet his sickness, for it is my office,"
5,1,1484,ADRIANA,"And will have no attorney but myself;"
5,1,1485,ADRIANA,"And therefore let me have him home with me."
5,1,1486,ABBESS,"Be patient, for I will not let him stir"
5,1,1487,ABBESS,"Till I have used the approved means I have,"
5,1,1488,ABBESS,"With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,"
5,1,1489,ABBESS,"To make of him a formal man again."
5,1,1490,ABBESS,"It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,"
5,1,1491,ABBESS,"A charitable duty of my order;"
5,1,1492,ABBESS,"Therefore depart, and leave him here with me."
5,1,1493,ADRIANA,"I will not hence and leave my husband here;"
5,1,1494,ADRIANA,"And ill it doth beseem your holiness"
5,1,1495,ADRIANA,"To separate the husband and the wife."
5,1,1496,ABBESS,"Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him."
5,1,1497,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit Abbess._]"
5,1,1498,LUCIANA,"Complain unto the duke of this indignity."
5,1,1499,ADRIANA,"Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet,"
5,1,1500,ADRIANA,"And never rise until my tears and prayers"
5,1,1501,ADRIANA,"Have won his grace to come in person hither"
5,1,1502,ADRIANA,"And take perforce my husband from the abbess."
5,1,1503,MERCHANT,"By this, I think, the dial points at five."
5,1,1504,MERCHANT,"Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person"
5,1,1505,MERCHANT,"Comes this way to the melancholy vale,"
5,1,1506,MERCHANT,"The place of death and sorry execution"
5,1,1507,MERCHANT,"Behind the ditches of the abbey here."
5,1,1508,ANGELO,"Upon what cause?"
5,1,1509,MERCHANT,"To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,"
5,1,1510,MERCHANT,"Who put unluckily into this bay"
5,1,1511,MERCHANT,"Against the laws and statutes of this town,"
5,1,1512,MERCHANT,"Beheaded publicly for his offence."
5,1,1513,ANGELO,"See where they come. We will behold his death."
5,1,1514,LUCIANA,"Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey."
5,1,1515,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter the Duke, attended; Egeon, bareheaded; with the Headsman and"
5,1,1516,STAGE DIRECTION," other Officers."
5,1,1517,DUKE,"Yet once again proclaim it publicly,"
5,1,1518,DUKE,"If any friend will pay the sum for him,"
5,1,1519,DUKE,"He shall not die; so much we tender him."
5,1,1520,ADRIANA,"Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!"
5,1,1521,DUKE,"She is a virtuous and a reverend lady,"
5,1,1522,DUKE,"It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong."
5,1,1523,ADRIANA,"May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,"
5,1,1524,ADRIANA,"Who I made lord of me and all I had"
5,1,1525,ADRIANA,"At your important letters, this ill day"
5,1,1526,ADRIANA,"A most outrageous fit of madness took him;"
5,1,1527,ADRIANA,"That desp’rately he hurried through the street,"
5,1,1528,ADRIANA,"With him his bondman all as mad as he,"
5,1,1529,ADRIANA,"Doing displeasure to the citizens"
5,1,1530,ADRIANA,"By rushing in their houses, bearing thence"
5,1,1531,ADRIANA,"Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like."
5,1,1532,ADRIANA,"Once did I get him bound and sent him home,"
5,1,1533,ADRIANA,"Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,"
5,1,1534,ADRIANA,"That here and there his fury had committed."
5,1,1535,ADRIANA,"Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,"
5,1,1536,ADRIANA,"He broke from those that had the guard of him,"
5,1,1537,ADRIANA,"And with his mad attendant and himself,"
5,1,1538,ADRIANA,"Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,"
5,1,1539,ADRIANA,"Met us again, and, madly bent on us,"
5,1,1540,ADRIANA,"Chased us away; till raising of more aid,"
5,1,1541,ADRIANA,"We came again to bind them. Then they fled"
5,1,1542,ADRIANA,"Into this abbey, whither we pursued them."
5,1,1543,ADRIANA,"And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,"
5,1,1544,ADRIANA,"And will not suffer us to fetch him out,"
5,1,1545,ADRIANA,"Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence."
5,1,1546,ADRIANA,"Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command"
5,1,1547,ADRIANA,"Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help."
5,1,1548,DUKE,"Long since thy husband serv’d me in my wars,"
5,1,1549,DUKE,"And I to thee engag’d a prince’s word,"
5,1,1550,DUKE,"When thou didst make him master of thy bed,"
5,1,1551,DUKE,"To do him all the grace and good I could."
5,1,1552,DUKE,"Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,"
5,1,1553,DUKE,"And bid the lady abbess come to me."
5,1,1554,DUKE,"I will determine this before I stir."
5,1,1555,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter a Messenger."
5,1,1556,MESSENGER,"O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself."
5,1,1557,MESSENGER,"My master and his man are both broke loose,"
5,1,1558,MESSENGER,"Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,"
5,1,1559,MESSENGER,"Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire,"
5,1,1560,MESSENGER,"And ever as it blazed they threw on him"
5,1,1561,MESSENGER,"Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair."
5,1,1562,MESSENGER,"My master preaches patience to him, and the while"
5,1,1563,MESSENGER,"His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;"
5,1,1564,MESSENGER,"And sure (unless you send some present help)"
5,1,1565,MESSENGER,"Between them they will kill the conjurer."
5,1,1566,ADRIANA,"Peace, fool, thy master and his man are here,"
5,1,1567,ADRIANA,"And that is false thou dost report to us."
5,1,1568,MESSENGER,"Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true."
5,1,1569,MESSENGER,"I have not breath’d almost since I did see it."
5,1,1570,MESSENGER,"He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,"
5,1,1571,MESSENGER,"To scorch your face and to disfigure you."
5,1,1572,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Cry within._]"
5,1,1573,MESSENGER,"Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, be gone!"
5,1,1574,DUKE,"Come, stand by me, fear nothing. Guard with halberds."
5,1,1575,ADRIANA,"Ay me, it is my husband. Witness you"
5,1,1576,ADRIANA,"That he is borne about invisible."
5,1,1577,ADRIANA,"Even now we hous’d him in the abbey here,"
5,1,1578,ADRIANA,"And now he’s there, past thought of human reason."
5,1,1579,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus."
5,1,1580,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Justice, most gracious duke; O, grant me justice!"
5,1,1581,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Even for the service that long since I did thee"
5,1,1582,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took"
5,1,1583,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood"
5,1,1584,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice."
5,1,1585,EGEON,"Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,"
5,1,1586,EGEON,"I see my son Antipholus and Dromio."
5,1,1587,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there."
5,1,1588,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife;"
5,1,1589,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That hath abused and dishonour’d me"
5,1,1590,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Even in the strength and height of injury."
5,1,1591,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Beyond imagination is the wrong"
5,1,1592,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That she this day hath shameless thrown on me."
5,1,1593,DUKE,"Discover how, and thou shalt find me just."
5,1,1594,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me"
5,1,1595,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"While she with harlots feasted in my house."
5,1,1596,DUKE,"A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?"
5,1,1597,ADRIANA,"No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister"
5,1,1598,ADRIANA,"Today did dine together. So befall my soul"
5,1,1599,ADRIANA,"As this is false he burdens me withal."
5,1,1600,LUCIANA,"Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night"
5,1,1601,LUCIANA,"But she tells to your highness simple truth."
5,1,1602,ANGELO,"O perjur’d woman! They are both forsworn."
5,1,1603,ANGELO,"In this the madman justly chargeth them."
5,1,1604,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My liege, I am advised what I say,"
5,1,1605,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Neither disturb’d with the effect of wine,"
5,1,1606,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Nor heady-rash, provok’d with raging ire,"
5,1,1607,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad."
5,1,1608,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"This woman lock’d me out this day from dinner."
5,1,1609,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That goldsmith there, were he not pack’d with her,"
5,1,1610,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Could witness it, for he was with me then,"
5,1,1611,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,"
5,1,1612,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,"
5,1,1613,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Where Balthasar and I did dine together."
5,1,1614,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,"
5,1,1615,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I went to seek him. In the street I met him,"
5,1,1616,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And in his company that gentleman."
5,1,1617,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down"
5,1,1618,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That I this day of him receiv’d the chain,"
5,1,1619,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Which, God he knows, I saw not. For the which"
5,1,1620,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"He did arrest me with an officer."
5,1,1621,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I did obey, and sent my peasant home"
5,1,1622,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For certain ducats. He with none return’d."
5,1,1623,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Then fairly I bespoke the officer"
5,1,1624,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To go in person with me to my house."
5,1,1625,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"By th’ way we met"
5,1,1626,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My wife, her sister, and a rabble more"
5,1,1627,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Of vile confederates. Along with them"
5,1,1628,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,"
5,1,1629,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A mere anatomy, a mountebank,"
5,1,1630,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller;"
5,1,1631,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A needy, hollow-ey’d, sharp-looking wretch;"
5,1,1632,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A living dead man. This pernicious slave,"
5,1,1633,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,"
5,1,1634,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,"
5,1,1635,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me,"
5,1,1636,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Cries out, I was possess’d. Then altogether"
5,1,1637,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,"
5,1,1638,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And in a dark and dankish vault at home"
5,1,1639,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There left me and my man, both bound together,"
5,1,1640,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,"
5,1,1641,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I gain’d my freedom and immediately"
5,1,1642,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech"
5,1,1643,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To give me ample satisfaction"
5,1,1644,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For these deep shames and great indignities."
5,1,1645,ANGELO,"My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,"
5,1,1646,ANGELO,"That he din’d not at home, but was lock’d out."
5,1,1647,DUKE,"But had he such a chain of thee, or no?"
5,1,1648,ANGELO,"He had, my lord, and when he ran in here"
5,1,1649,ANGELO,"These people saw the chain about his neck."
5,1,1650,MERCHANT,"Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine"
5,1,1651,MERCHANT,"Heard you confess you had the chain of him,"
5,1,1652,MERCHANT,"After you first forswore it on the mart,"
5,1,1653,MERCHANT,"And thereupon I drew my sword on you;"
5,1,1654,MERCHANT,"And then you fled into this abbey here,"
5,1,1655,MERCHANT,"From whence I think you are come by miracle."
5,1,1656,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never came within these abbey walls,"
5,1,1657,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me."
5,1,1658,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never saw the chain, so help me heaven;"
5,1,1659,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And this is false you burden me withal."
5,1,1660,DUKE,"Why, what an intricate impeach is this!"
5,1,1661,DUKE,"I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup."
5,1,1662,DUKE,"If here you hous’d him, here he would have been."
5,1,1663,DUKE,"If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly."
5,1,1664,DUKE,"You say he din’d at home, the goldsmith here"
5,1,1665,DUKE,"Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?"
5,1,1666,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine."
5,1,1667,COURTESAN,"He did, and from my finger snatch’d that ring."
5,1,1668,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her."
5,1,1669,DUKE,"Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?"
5,1,1670,COURTESAN,"As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace."
5,1,1671,DUKE,"Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither."
5,1,1672,DUKE,"I think you are all mated, or stark mad."
5,1,1673,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit one to the Abbess._]"
5,1,1674,EGEON,"Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word;"
5,1,1675,EGEON,"Haply I see a friend will save my life"
5,1,1676,EGEON,"And pay the sum that may deliver me."
5,1,1677,DUKE,"Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt."
5,1,1678,EGEON,"Is not your name, sir, call’d Antipholus?"
5,1,1679,EGEON,"And is not that your bondman Dromio?"
5,1,1680,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,"
5,1,1681,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But he, I thank him, gnaw’d in two my cords."
5,1,1682,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound."
5,1,1683,EGEON,"I am sure you both of you remember me."
5,1,1684,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you."
5,1,1685,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For lately we were bound as you are now."
5,1,1686,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?"
5,1,1687,EGEON,"Why look you strange on me? you know me well."
5,1,1688,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never saw you in my life till now."
5,1,1689,EGEON,"O! grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last,"
5,1,1690,EGEON,"And careful hours with time’s deformed hand,"
5,1,1691,EGEON,"Have written strange defeatures in my face."
5,1,1692,EGEON,"But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?"
5,1,1693,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Neither."
5,1,1694,EGEON,"Dromio, nor thou?"
5,1,1695,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"No, trust me, sir, nor I."
5,1,1696,EGEON,"I am sure thou dost."
5,1,1697,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you are"
5,1,1698,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"now bound to believe him."
5,1,1699,EGEON,"Not know my voice! O time’s extremity,"
5,1,1700,EGEON,"Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue"
5,1,1701,EGEON,"In seven short years that here my only son"
5,1,1702,EGEON,"Knows not my feeble key of untun’d cares?"
5,1,1703,EGEON,"Though now this grained face of mine be hid"
5,1,1704,EGEON,"In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow,"
5,1,1705,EGEON,"And all the conduits of my blood froze up,"

5,1,1709,EGEON,"All these old witnesses, I cannot err,"
5,1,1710,EGEON,"Tell me thou art my son Antipholus."
5,1,1711,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never saw my father in my life."
5,1,1712,EGEON,"But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,"
5,1,1713,EGEON,"Thou know’st we parted; but perhaps, my son,"
5,1,1714,EGEON,"Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery."
5,1,1715,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"The duke and all that know me in the city,"
5,1,1716,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Can witness with me that it is not so."

5,1,1728,DUKE,"And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?"
5,1,1729,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I, sir, am Dromio, command him away."
5,1,1730,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I, sir, am Dromio, pray let me stay."
5,1,1731,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Egeon, art thou not? or else his ghost?"
5,1,1732,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"O, my old master, who hath bound him here?"
5,1,1733,ABBESS,"Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,"
5,1,1734,ABBESS,"And gain a husband by his liberty."
5,1,1735,ABBESS,"Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man"
5,1,1736,ABBESS,"That hadst a wife once called Emilia,"
5,1,1737,ABBESS,"That bore thee at a burden two fair sons."
5,1,1738,ABBESS,"O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,"
5,1,1739,ABBESS,"And speak unto the same Emilia!"
5,1,1740,DUKE,"Why, here begins his morning story right:"
5,1,1741,DUKE,"These two Antipholus’, these two so like,"
5,1,1742,DUKE,"And these two Dromios, one in semblance,"
5,1,1743,DUKE,"Besides her urging of her wreck at sea."
5,1,1744,DUKE,"These are the parents to these children,"
5,1,1745,DUKE,"Which accidentally are met together."
5,1,1746,EGEON,"If I dream not, thou art Emilia."
5,1,1747,EGEON,"If thou art she, tell me where is that son"
5,1,1748,EGEON,"That floated with thee on the fatal raft?"
5,1,1749,ABBESS,"By men of Epidamnum, he and I"
5,1,1750,ABBESS,"And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;"
5,1,1751,ABBESS,"But, by and by, rude fishermen of Corinth"
5,1,1752,ABBESS,"By force took Dromio and my son from them,"
5,1,1753,ABBESS,"And me they left with those of Epidamnum."
5,1,1754,ABBESS,"What then became of them I cannot tell;"
5,1,1755,ABBESS,"I to this fortune that you see me in."
5,1,1756,DUKE,"Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first?"
5,1,1757,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse."
5,1,1758,DUKE,"Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which."
5,1,1759,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord."
5,1,1760,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And I with him."
5,1,1761,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,"
5,1,1762,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle."
5,1,1763,ADRIANA,"Which of you two did dine with me today?"
5,1,1764,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I, gentle mistress."
5,1,1765,ADRIANA,"And are not you my husband?"
5,1,1766,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"No, I say nay to that."
5,1,1767,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And so do I, yet did she call me so;"
5,1,1768,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,"
5,1,1769,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Did call me brother. What I told you then,"
5,1,1770,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I hope I shall have leisure to make good,"
5,1,1771,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If this be not a dream I see and hear."
5,1,1772,ANGELO,"That is the chain, sir, which you had of me."
5,1,1773,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I think it be, sir. I deny it not."
5,1,1774,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And you, sir, for this chain arrested me."
5,1,1775,ANGELO,"I think I did, sir. I deny it not."
5,1,1776,ADRIANA,"I sent you money, sir, to be your bail"
5,1,1777,ADRIANA,"By Dromio, but I think he brought it not."
5,1,1778,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"No, none by me."
5,1,1779,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"This purse of ducats I receiv’d from you,"
5,1,1780,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And Dromio my man did bring them me."
5,1,1781,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I see we still did meet each other’s man,"
5,1,1782,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,"
5,1,1783,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And thereupon these errors are arose."
5,1,1784,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"These ducats pawn I for my father here."
5,1,1785,DUKE,"It shall not need, thy father hath his life."
5,1,1786,COURTESAN,"Sir, I must have that diamond from you."
5,1,1787,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer."
5,1,1788,ABBESS,"Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains"
5,1,1789,ABBESS,"To go with us into the abbey here,"
5,1,1790,ABBESS,"And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;"
5,1,1791,ABBESS,"And all that are assembled in this place,"
5,1,1792,ABBESS,"That by this sympathised one day’s error"
5,1,1793,ABBESS,"Have suffer’d wrong, go, keep us company,"
5,1,1794,ABBESS,"And we shall make full satisfaction."
5,1,1795,ABBESS,"Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail"
5,1,1796,ABBESS,"Of you, my sons, and till this present hour"
5,1,1797,ABBESS,"My heavy burden ne’er delivered."
5,1,1798,ABBESS,"The duke, my husband, and my children both,"
5,1,1799,ABBESS,"And you, the calendars of their nativity,"
5,1,1800,ABBESS,"Go to a gossips’ feast, and go with me."
5,1,1801,ABBESS,"After so long grief, such nativity."
5,1,1802,DUKE,"With all my heart, I’ll gossip at this feast."

5,1,1804,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?"
5,1,1805,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark’d?"
5,1,1806,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur."
5,1,1807,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"He speaks to me; I am your master, Dromio."
5,1,1808,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Come, go with us. We’ll look to that anon."
5,1,1809,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Embrace thy brother there, rejoice with him."

5,1,1811,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"There is a fat friend at your master’s house,"
5,1,1812,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"That kitchen’d me for you today at dinner."
5,1,1813,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"She now shall be my sister, not my wife."
5,1,1814,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother."
5,1,1815,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth."
5,1,1816,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Will you walk in to see their gossiping?"
5,1,1817,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not I, sir, you are my elder."
5,1,1818,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That’s a question, how shall we try it?"
5,1,1819,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"We’ll draw cuts for the senior. Till then, lead thou first."
5,1,1820,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, then, thus:"
5,1,1821,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"We came into the world like brother and brother,"
5,1,1822,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another."
