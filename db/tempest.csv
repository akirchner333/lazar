1,1,3,MASTER OF A SHIP,"Boatswain!"
1,1,4,BOATSWAIN,"Here, master: what cheer?"
1,1,5,MASTER OF A SHIP,"Good, speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely, or"
1,1,6,MASTER OF A SHIP,"we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir."

1,1,11,BOATSWAIN,"yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s"

1,1,14,STAGE DIRECTION," and others._"
1,1,15,AONSO,"Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?"
1,1,16,AONSO,"Play the men."
1,1,17,BOATSWAIN,"I pray now, keep below."
1,1,18,ANTONIO,"Where is the master, boatswain?"
1,1,19,BOATSWAIN,"Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:"
1,1,20,BOATSWAIN,"keep your cabins: you do assist the storm."
1,1,21,GONZALO,"Nay, good, be patient."
1,1,22,BOATSWAIN,"When the sea is. Hence! What cares these"
1,1,23,BOATSWAIN,"roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble"
1,1,24,BOATSWAIN,"us not."
1,1,25,GONZALO,"Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard."
1,1,26,BOATSWAIN,"None that I more love than myself. You are a"
1,1,27,BOATSWAIN,"Counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,"
1,1,28,BOATSWAIN,"and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope"
1,1,29,BOATSWAIN,"more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you"
1,1,30,BOATSWAIN,"have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin"
1,1,31,BOATSWAIN,"for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good"
1,1,32,BOATSWAIN,"hearts! Out of our way, I say."
1,1,33,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit._"
1,1,34,GONZALO,"I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks"
1,1,35,GONZALO,"he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is"
1,1,36,GONZALO,"perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:"
1,1,37,GONZALO,"make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth"
1,1,38,GONZALO,"little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case"

1,1,43,BOATSWAIN,"Bring her to try with main-course."
1,1,44,STAGE DIRECTION," [_A cry within._]"
1,1,45,BOATSWAIN,"A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather"

1,1,47,STAGE DIRECTION," _Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO._"
1,1,48,BOATSWAIN,"Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o’er, and"
1,1,49,BOATSWAIN,"drown? Have you a mind to sink?"
1,1,50,SEBASTIAN,"A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,"
1,1,51,SEBASTIAN,"incharitable dog!"
1,1,52,BOATSWAIN,"Work you, then."
1,1,53,ANTONIO,"Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker."
1,1,54,ANTONIO,"We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art."
1,1,55,GONZALO,"I’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship"
1,1,56,GONZALO,"were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched"
1,1,57,GONZALO,"wench."
1,1,58,BOATSWAIN,"Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off"
1,1,59,BOATSWAIN,"to sea again; lay her off."

1,1,61,MARINERS,"All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!"
1,1,62,BOATSWAIN,"What, must our mouths be cold?"
1,1,63,GONZALO,"The king and prince at prayers! let’s assist them,"
1,1,64,GONZALO,"For our case is as theirs."
1,1,65,SEBASTIAN,"I’m out of patience."
1,1,66,ANTONIO,"We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:"
1,1,67,ANTONIO,"This wide-chapp’d rascal,--would thou mightst lie drowning"
1,1,68,ANTONIO,"The washing of ten tides!"
1,1,69,GONZALO,"He’ll be hang’d yet,"
1,1,70,GONZALO,"Though every drop of water swear against it,"

1,1,76,SEBASTIAN,"Let’s take leave of him."
1,1,77,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt Ant. and Seb._"
1,1,78,GONZALO,"Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for"
1,1,79,GONZALO,"an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any"

1,2,83,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE II. _The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell._"

1,2,85,MIRANDA,"If by your art, my dearest father, you have"
1,2,86,MIRANDA,"Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them."
1,2,87,MIRANDA,"The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,"
1,2,88,MIRANDA,"But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,"
1,2,89,MIRANDA,"Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer’d"
1,2,90,MIRANDA,"With those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,"
1,2,91,MIRANDA,"Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,"
1,2,92,MIRANDA,"Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock"
1,2,93,MIRANDA,"Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish’d!"
1,2,94,MIRANDA,"Had I been any god of power, I would"
1,2,95,MIRANDA,"Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere"
1,2,96,MIRANDA,"It should the good ship so have swallow’d and"
1,2,97,MIRANDA,"The fraughting souls within her."
1,2,98,PROSPERO,"Be collected:"
1,2,99,PROSPERO,"No more amazement: tell your piteous heart"
1,2,100,PROSPERO,"There’s no harm done."
1,2,101,MIRANDA,"O, woe the day!"
1,2,102,PROSPERO,"No harm."
1,2,103,PROSPERO,"I have done nothing but in care of thee,"
1,2,104,PROSPERO,"Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who"
1,2,105,PROSPERO,"Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing"
1,2,106,PROSPERO,"Of whence I am, nor that I am more better"
1,2,107,PROSPERO,"Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,"
1,2,108,PROSPERO,"And thy no greater father."
1,2,109,MIRANDA,"More to know"
1,2,110,MIRANDA,"Did never meddle with my thoughts."
1,2,111,PROSPERO,"’Tis time"
1,2,112,PROSPERO,"I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,"
1,2,113,PROSPERO,"And pluck my magic garment from me. --So:"
1,2,114,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Lays down his mantle._"
1,2,115,PROSPERO,"Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort."
1,2,116,PROSPERO,"The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d"
1,2,117,PROSPERO,"The very virtue of compassion in thee,"
1,2,118,PROSPERO,"I have with such provision in mine art"
1,2,119,PROSPERO,"So safely order’d, that there is no soul,"
1,2,120,PROSPERO,"No, not so much perdition as an hair"
1,2,121,PROSPERO,"Betid to any creature in the vessel"
1,2,122,PROSPERO,"Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;"
1,2,123,PROSPERO,"For thou must now know farther."
1,2,124,MIRANDA,"You have often"
1,2,125,MIRANDA,"Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp’d,"
1,2,126,MIRANDA,"And left me to a bootless inquisition,"
1,2,127,MIRANDA,"Concluding “Stay: not yet.”"
1,2,128,PROSPERO,"The hour’s now come;"
1,2,129,PROSPERO,"The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;"
1,2,130,PROSPERO,"Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember"
1,2,131,PROSPERO,"A time before we came unto this cell?"
1,2,132,PROSPERO,"I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not"
1,2,133,PROSPERO,"Out three years old."
1,2,134,MIRANDA,"Certainly, sir, I can."
1,2,135,PROSPERO,"By what? by any other house or person?"
1,2,136,PROSPERO,"Of any thing the image tell me that"
1,2,137,PROSPERO,"Hath kept with thy remembrance."
1,2,138,MIRANDA,"’Tis far off,"
1,2,139,MIRANDA,"And rather like a dream than an assurance"
1,2,140,MIRANDA,"That my remembrance warrants. Had I not"
1,2,141,MIRANDA,"Four or five women once that tended me?"
1,2,142,PROSPERO,"Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it"
1,2,143,PROSPERO,"That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else"
1,2,144,PROSPERO,"In the dark backward and abysm of time?"
1,2,145,PROSPERO,"If thou remember’st ought ere thou camest here,"
1,2,146,PROSPERO,"How thou camest here thou mayst."
1,2,147,MIRANDA,"But that I do not."
1,2,148,PROSPERO,"Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,"
1,2,149,PROSPERO,"Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and"
1,2,150,PROSPERO,"A prince of power."
1,2,151,MIRANDA,"Sir, are not you my father?"
1,2,152,PROSPERO,"Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and"
1,2,153,PROSPERO,"She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father"
1,2,154,PROSPERO,"Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir"
1,2,155,PROSPERO,"And princess, no worse issued."
1,2,156,MIRANDA,"O the heavens!"
1,2,157,MIRANDA,"What foul play had we, that we came from thence?"
1,2,158,MIRANDA,"Or blessed was’t we did?"
1,2,159,PROSPERO,"Both, both, my girl:"
1,2,160,PROSPERO,"By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence;"
1,2,161,PROSPERO,"But blessedly holp hither."
1,2,162,MIRANDA,"O, my heart bleeds"
1,2,163,MIRANDA,"To think o’ the teen that I have turn’d you to."
1,2,164,MIRANDA,"Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther."
1,2,165,PROSPERO,"My brother, and thy uncle, call’d Antonio,--"
1,2,166,PROSPERO,"I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should"
1,2,167,PROSPERO,"Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself,"
1,2,168,PROSPERO,"Of all the world I loved, and to him put"
1,2,169,PROSPERO,"The manage of my state; as, at that time,"
1,2,170,PROSPERO,"Through all the signories it was the first,"
1,2,171,PROSPERO,"And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed"
1,2,172,PROSPERO,"In dignity, and for the liberal arts"
1,2,173,PROSPERO,"Without a parallel; those being all my study,"
1,2,174,PROSPERO,"The government I cast upon my brother,"
1,2,175,PROSPERO,"And to my state grew stranger, being transported"
1,2,176,PROSPERO,"And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--"
1,2,177,PROSPERO,"Dost thou attend me?"
1,2,178,MIRANDA,"Sir, most heedfully."
1,2,179,PROSPERO,"Being once perfected how to grant suits,"
1,2,180,PROSPERO,"How to deny them, whom to advance, and whom"
1,2,181,PROSPERO,"To trash for over-topping, new created"
1,2,182,PROSPERO,"The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,"
1,2,183,PROSPERO,"Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key"
1,2,184,PROSPERO,"Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state"
1,2,185,PROSPERO,"To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was"
1,2,186,PROSPERO,"The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,"
1,2,187,PROSPERO,"And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not."
1,2,188,MIRANDA,"O, good sir, I do."
1,2,189,PROSPERO,"I pray thee, mark me."
1,2,190,PROSPERO,"I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated"
1,2,191,PROSPERO,"To closeness and the bettering of my mind"
1,2,192,PROSPERO,"With that which, but by being so retired,"
1,2,193,PROSPERO,"O’er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother"
1,2,194,PROSPERO,"Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,"
1,2,195,PROSPERO,"Like a good parent, did beget of him"
1,2,196,PROSPERO,"A falsehood in its contrary, as great"
1,2,197,PROSPERO,"As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,"
1,2,198,PROSPERO,"A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,"
1,2,199,PROSPERO,"Not only with what my revenue yielded,"
1,2,200,PROSPERO,"But what my power might else exact, like one"
1,2,201,PROSPERO,"Who having into truth, by telling of it,"
1,2,202,PROSPERO,"Made such a sinner of his memory,"
1,2,203,PROSPERO,"To credit his own lie, he did believe"
1,2,204,PROSPERO,"He was indeed the duke; out o’ the substitution,"
1,2,205,PROSPERO,"And executing the outward face of royalty,"
1,2,206,PROSPERO,"With all prerogative:--hence his ambition growing,--"
1,2,207,PROSPERO,"Dost thou hear?"
1,2,208,MIRANDA,"Your tale, sir, would cure deafness."
1,2,209,PROSPERO,"To have no screen between this part he play’d"
1,2,210,PROSPERO,"And him he play’d it for, he needs will be"
1,2,211,PROSPERO,"Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library"
1,2,212,PROSPERO,"Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties"
1,2,213,PROSPERO,"He thinks me now incapable; confederates,"
1,2,214,PROSPERO,"So dry he was for sway, wi’ the King of Naples"
1,2,215,PROSPERO,"To give him annual tribute, do him homage,"
1,2,216,PROSPERO,"Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend"
1,2,217,PROSPERO,"The dukedom, yet unbow’d,--alas, poor Milan!--"
1,2,218,PROSPERO,"To most ignoble stooping."
1,2,219,MIRANDA,"O the heavens!"
1,2,220,PROSPERO,"Mark his condition, and th’ event; then tell me"
1,2,221,PROSPERO,"If this might be a brother."
1,2,222,MIRANDA,"I should sin"
1,2,223,MIRANDA,"To think but nobly of my grandmother:"
1,2,224,MIRANDA,"Good wombs have borne bad sons."
1,2,225,PROSPERO,"Now the condition."
1,2,226,PROSPERO,"This King of Naples, being an enemy"
1,2,227,PROSPERO,"To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;"
1,2,228,PROSPERO,"Which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises,"
1,2,229,PROSPERO,"Of homage and I know not how much tribute,"
1,2,230,PROSPERO,"Should presently extirpate me and mine"
1,2,231,PROSPERO,"Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,"
1,2,232,PROSPERO,"With all the honours, on my brother: whereon,"
1,2,233,PROSPERO,"A treacherous army levied, one midnight"
1,2,234,PROSPERO,"Fated to the purpose, did Antonio open"
1,2,235,PROSPERO,"The gates of Milan; and, i’ the dead of darkness,"
1,2,236,PROSPERO,"The ministers for the purpose hurried thence"
1,2,237,PROSPERO,"Me and thy crying self."
1,2,238,MIRANDA,"Alack, for pity!"
1,2,239,MIRANDA,"I, not remembering how I cried out then,"
1,2,240,MIRANDA,"Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint"
1,2,241,MIRANDA,"That wrings mine eyes to’t."
1,2,242,PROSPERO,"Hear a little further,"
1,2,243,PROSPERO,"And then I’ll bring thee to the present business"
1,2,244,PROSPERO,"Which now’s upon ’s; without the which, this story"
1,2,245,PROSPERO,"Were most impertinent."
1,2,246,MIRANDA,"Wherefore did they not"
1,2,247,MIRANDA,"That hour destroy us?"
1,2,248,PROSPERO,"Well demanded, wench:"
1,2,249,PROSPERO,"My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,"
1,2,250,PROSPERO,"So dear the love my people bore me; nor set"
1,2,251,PROSPERO,"A mark so bloody on the business; but"
1,2,252,PROSPERO,"With colours fairer painted their foul ends."
1,2,253,PROSPERO,"In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,"
1,2,254,PROSPERO,"Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared"
1,2,255,PROSPERO,"A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg’d,"
1,2,256,PROSPERO,"Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats"
1,2,257,PROSPERO,"Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,"
1,2,258,PROSPERO,"To cry to the sea that roar’d to us; to sigh"
1,2,259,PROSPERO,"To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again,"
1,2,260,PROSPERO,"Did us but loving wrong."
1,2,261,MIRANDA,"Alack, what trouble"
1,2,262,MIRANDA,"Was I then to you!"
1,2,263,PROSPERO,"O, a cherubin"
1,2,264,PROSPERO,"Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,"
1,2,265,PROSPERO,"Infused with a fortitude from heaven,"
1,2,266,PROSPERO,"When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,"
1,2,267,PROSPERO,"Under my burthen groan’d; which raised in me"
1,2,268,PROSPERO,"An undergoing stomach, to bear up"
1,2,269,PROSPERO,"Against what should ensue."
1,2,270,MIRANDA,"How came we ashore?"
1,2,271,PROSPERO,"By Providence divine."
1,2,272,PROSPERO,"Some food we had, and some fresh water, that"
1,2,273,PROSPERO,"A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,"
1,2,274,PROSPERO,"Out of his charity, who being then appointed"
1,2,275,PROSPERO,"Master of this design, did give us, with"
1,2,276,PROSPERO,"Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,"
1,2,277,PROSPERO,"Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,"
1,2,278,PROSPERO,"Knowing I loved my books, he furnish’d me"
1,2,279,PROSPERO,"From mine own library with volumes that"
1,2,280,PROSPERO,"I prize above my dukedom."
1,2,281,MIRANDA,"Would I might"
1,2,282,MIRANDA,"But ever see that man!"
1,2,283,PROSPERO,"Now I arise:"
1,2,284,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Resumes his mantle._"
1,2,285,PROSPERO,"Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow."
1,2,286,PROSPERO,"Here in this island we arrived; and here"
1,2,287,PROSPERO,"Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit"
1,2,288,PROSPERO,"Than other princesses can, that have more time"
1,2,289,PROSPERO,"For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful."
1,2,290,MIRANDA,"Heavens thank you for’t! And now, I pray you, sir,"
1,2,291,MIRANDA,"For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason"
1,2,292,MIRANDA,"For raising this sea-storm?"
1,2,293,PROSPERO,"Know thus far forth."
1,2,294,PROSPERO,"By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,"
1,2,295,PROSPERO,"Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies"
1,2,296,PROSPERO,"Brought to this shore; and by my prescience"
1,2,297,PROSPERO,"I find my zenith doth depend upon"
1,2,298,PROSPERO,"A most auspicious star, whose influence"
1,2,299,PROSPERO,"If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes"
1,2,300,PROSPERO,"Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:"
1,2,301,PROSPERO,"Thou art inclined to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,"
1,2,302,PROSPERO,"And give it way: I know thou canst not choose."
1,2,303,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Miranda sleeps._"
1,2,304,PROSPERO,"Come away, servant, come. I am ready now."
1,2,305,PROSPERO,"Approach, my Ariel, come."
1,2,306,STAGE DIRECTION," _Enter _ARIEL_._"
1,2,307,ARIEL,"All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come"
1,2,308,ARIEL,"To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,"
1,2,309,ARIEL,"To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride"
1,2,310,ARIEL,"On the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task"
1,2,311,ARIEL,"Ariel and all his quality."
1,2,312,PROSPERO,"Hast thou, spirit,"
1,2,313,PROSPERO,"Perform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?"
1,2,314,ARIEL,"To every article."
1,2,315,ARIEL,"I boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak,"
1,2,316,ARIEL,"Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,"
1,2,317,ARIEL,"I flamed amazement: sometime I’ld divide,"
1,2,318,ARIEL,"And burn in many places; on the topmast,"
1,2,319,ARIEL,"The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,"
1,2,320,ARIEL,"Then meet and join. Jove’s lightnings, the precursors"
1,2,321,ARIEL,"O’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary"
1,2,322,ARIEL,"And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks"
1,2,323,ARIEL,"Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune"
1,2,324,ARIEL,"Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,"
1,2,325,ARIEL,"Yea, his dread trident shake."
1,2,326,PROSPERO,"My brave spirit!"
1,2,327,PROSPERO,"Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil"
1,2,328,PROSPERO,"Would not infect his reason?"
1,2,329,ARIEL,"Not a soul"
1,2,330,ARIEL,"But felt a fever of the mad, and play’d"
1,2,331,ARIEL,"Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners"
1,2,332,ARIEL,"Plunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,"
1,2,333,ARIEL,"Then all afire with me: the king’s son, Ferdinand,"
1,2,334,ARIEL,"With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--"
1,2,335,ARIEL,"Was the first man that leap’d; cried, “Hell is empty,"
1,2,336,ARIEL,"And all the devils are here.”"
1,2,337,PROSPERO,"Why, that’s my spirit!"
1,2,338,PROSPERO,"But was not this nigh shore?"
1,2,339,ARIEL,"Close by, my master."
1,2,340,PROSPERO,"But are they, Ariel, safe?"
1,2,341,ARIEL,"Not a hair perish’d;"
1,2,342,ARIEL,"On their sustaining garments not a blemish,"
1,2,343,ARIEL,"But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,"
1,2,344,ARIEL,"In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle."
1,2,345,ARIEL,"The king’s son have I landed by himself;"
1,2,346,ARIEL,"Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs"
1,2,347,ARIEL,"In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,"
1,2,348,ARIEL,"His arms in this sad knot."
1,2,349,PROSPERO,"Of the king’s ship"
1,2,350,PROSPERO,"The mariners, say how thou hast disposed,"
1,2,351,PROSPERO,"And all the rest o’ the fleet."
1,2,352,ARIEL,"Safely in harbour"
1,2,353,ARIEL,"Is the king’s ship; in the deep nook, where once"
1,2,354,ARIEL,"Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew"
1,2,355,ARIEL,"From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid:"
1,2,356,ARIEL,"The mariners all under hatches stow’d;"
1,2,357,ARIEL,"Who, with a charm join’d to their suffer’d labour,"
1,2,358,ARIEL,"I have left asleep: and for the rest o’ the fleet,"
1,2,359,ARIEL,"Which I dispersed, they all have met again,"
1,2,360,ARIEL,"And are upon the Mediterranean flote,"
1,2,361,ARIEL,"Bound sadly home for Naples;"
1,2,362,ARIEL,"Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wreck’d,"
1,2,363,ARIEL,"And his great person perish."
1,2,364,PROSPERO,"Ariel, thy charge"
1,2,365,PROSPERO,"Exactly is perform’d: but there’s more work."
1,2,366,PROSPERO,"What is the time o’ the day?"
1,2,367,ARIEL,"Past the mid season."
1,2,368,PROSPERO,"At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now"
1,2,369,PROSPERO,"Must by us both be spent most preciously."
1,2,370,ARIEL,"Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,"
1,2,371,ARIEL,"Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,"
1,2,372,ARIEL,"Which is not yet perform’d me."
1,2,373,PROSPERO,"How now? moody?"
1,2,374,PROSPERO,"What is’t thou canst demand?"
1,2,375,ARIEL,"My liberty."
1,2,376,STAGE DIRECTION," Before the time be out? no more!"
1,2,377,ARIEL,"I prithee,"
1,2,378,ARIEL,"Remember I have done thee worthy service;"
1,2,379,ARIEL,"Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served"
1,2,380,ARIEL,"Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise"
1,2,381,ARIEL,"To bate me a full year."
1,2,382,PROSPERO,"Dost thou forget"
1,2,383,PROSPERO,"From what a torment I did free thee?"
1,2,384,ARIEL,"No.-"
1,2,385,PROSPERO,"Thou dost; and think’st it much to tread the ooze"
1,2,386,PROSPERO,"Of the salt deep,"
1,2,387,PROSPERO,"To run upon the sharp wind of the north,"
1,2,388,PROSPERO,"To do me business in the veins o’ the earth"
1,2,389,PROSPERO,"When it is baked with frost."
1,2,390,ARIEL,"I do not, sir."
1,2,391,PROSPERO,"Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot"
1,2,392,PROSPERO,"The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy"
1,2,393,PROSPERO,"Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?"
1,2,394,ARIEL,"No, sir."
1,2,395,PROSPERO,"Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me."
1,2,396,ARIEL,"Sir, in Argier."
1,2,397,PROSPERO,"O, was she so? I must"
1,2,398,PROSPERO,"Once in a month recount what thou hast been,"
1,2,399,PROSPERO,"Which thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,"
1,2,400,PROSPERO,"For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible"
1,2,401,PROSPERO,"To enter human hearing, from Argier,"
1,2,402,PROSPERO,"Thou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did"
1,2,403,PROSPERO,"They would not take her life. Is not this true?"
1,2,404,ARIEL,"Ay, sir."
1,2,405,PROSPERO,"This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,"
1,2,406,PROSPERO,"And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,"
1,2,407,PROSPERO,"As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;"
1,2,408,PROSPERO,"And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate"
1,2,409,PROSPERO,"To act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,"
1,2,410,PROSPERO,"Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,"
1,2,411,PROSPERO,"By help of her more potent ministers,"
1,2,412,PROSPERO,"And in her most unmitigable rage,"
1,2,413,PROSPERO,"Into a cloven pine; within which rift"
1,2,414,PROSPERO,"Imprison’d thou didst painfully remain"
1,2,415,PROSPERO,"A dozen years; within which space she died,"
1,2,416,PROSPERO,"And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans"
1,2,417,PROSPERO,"As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--"
1,2,418,PROSPERO,"Save for the son that she did litter here,"
1,2,419,PROSPERO,"A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour’d with"
1,2,420,PROSPERO,"A human shape."
1,2,421,ARIEL,"Yes, Caliban her son."
1,2,422,PROSPERO,"Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,"
1,2,423,PROSPERO,"Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st"
1,2,424,PROSPERO,"What torment I did find thee in; thy groans"
1,2,425,PROSPERO,"Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts"
1,2,426,PROSPERO,"Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment"
1,2,427,PROSPERO,"To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax"
1,2,428,PROSPERO,"Could not again undo: it was mine art,"
1,2,429,PROSPERO,"When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape"
1,2,430,PROSPERO,"The pine, and let thee out."
1,2,431,ARIEL,"I thank thee, master."
1,2,432,PROSPERO,"If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak,"
1,2,433,PROSPERO,"And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till"
1,2,434,PROSPERO,"Thou hast howl’d away twelve winters."
1,2,435,ARIEL,"Pardon, master:"
1,2,436,ARIEL,"I will be correspondent to command,"
1,2,437,ARIEL,"And do my spiriting gently."
1,2,438,PROSPERO,"Do so; and after two days"
1,2,439,PROSPERO,"I will discharge thee."
1,2,440,ARIEL,"That’s my noble master!"
1,2,441,ARIEL,"What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?"
1,2,442,PROSPERO,"Go make thyself like a nymph o’ the sea:"
1,2,443,PROSPERO,"Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible"
1,2,444,PROSPERO,"To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,"
1,2,445,PROSPERO,"And hither come in’t: go, hence with diligence!"
1,2,446,STAGE DIRECTION,"   [_Exit Ariel._"
1,2,447,PROSPERO,"Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;"
1,2,448,PROSPERO,"Awake!"
1,2,449,MIRANDA,"The strangeness of your story put"
1,2,450,MIRANDA,"Heaviness in me."
1,2,451,PROSPERO,"Shake it off. Come on;"
1,2,452,PROSPERO,"We’ll visit Caliban my slave, who never"
1,2,453,PROSPERO,"Yields us kind answer."
1,2,454,MIRANDA,"’Tis a villain, sir,"
1,2,455,MIRANDA,"I do not love to look on."
1,2,456,PROSPERO,"But, as ’tis,"
1,2,457,PROSPERO,"We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,"
1,2,458,PROSPERO,"Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices"
1,2,459,PROSPERO,"That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!"
1,2,460,PROSPERO,"Thou earth, thou! speak."
1,2,461,CALIBAN,"[_within_] There’s wood enough within."
1,2,462,STAGE DIRECTION," Come forth, I say! there’s other business for thee:"
1,2,463,PROSPERO,"Come, thou tortoise! when?"
1,2,464,STAGE DIRECTION," _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._"
1,2,465,PROSPERO,"Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,"
1,2,466,PROSPERO,"Hark in thine ear."
1,2,467,ARIEL,"My lord, it shall be done."
1,2,468,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit._"
1,2,469,PROSPERO,"Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself"
1,2,470,PROSPERO,"Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!"
1,2,471,STAGE DIRECTION," _Enter CALIBAN._"
1,2,472,CALIBAN,"As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d"
1,2,473,CALIBAN,"With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen"
1,2,474,CALIBAN,"Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye"
1,2,475,CALIBAN,"And blister you all o’er!"
1,2,476,PROSPERO,"For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,"
1,2,477,PROSPERO,"Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins"
1,2,478,PROSPERO,"Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,"
1,2,479,PROSPERO,"All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch’d"
1,2,480,PROSPERO,"As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging"
1,2,481,PROSPERO,"Than bees that made ’em."
1,2,482,CALIBAN,"I must eat my dinner."
1,2,483,CALIBAN,"This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,"
1,2,484,CALIBAN,"Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,"
1,2,485,CALIBAN,"Thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me"
1,2,486,CALIBAN,"Water with berries in’t; and teach me how"
1,2,487,CALIBAN,"To name the bigger light, and how the less,"
1,2,488,CALIBAN,"That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,"
1,2,489,CALIBAN,"And show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,"
1,2,490,CALIBAN,"The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:"
1,2,491,CALIBAN,"Curs’d be I that did so! All the charms"
1,2,492,CALIBAN,"Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!"
1,2,493,CALIBAN,"For I am all the subjects that you have,"
1,2,494,CALIBAN,"Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me"
1,2,495,CALIBAN,"In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me"
1,2,496,CALIBAN,"The rest o’ th’ island."
1,2,497,PROSPERO,"Thou most lying slave,"
1,2,498,PROSPERO,"Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,"
1,2,499,PROSPERO,"Filth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee"
1,2,500,PROSPERO,"In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate"
1,2,501,PROSPERO,"The honour of my child."
1,2,502,CALIBAN,"O ho, O ho! would ’t had been done!"
1,2,503,CALIBAN,"Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else"
1,2,504,CALIBAN,"This isle with Calibans."
1,2,505,PROSPERO,"Abhorred slave,"
1,2,506,PROSPERO,"Which any print of goodness wilt not take,"
1,2,507,PROSPERO,"Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,"
1,2,508,PROSPERO,"Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour"
1,2,509,PROSPERO,"One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,"
1,2,510,PROSPERO,"Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like"
1,2,511,PROSPERO,"A thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes"
1,2,512,PROSPERO,"With words that made them known. But thy vile race,"
1,2,513,PROSPERO,"Though thou didst learn, had that in’t which good natures"
1,2,514,PROSPERO,"Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou"
1,2,515,PROSPERO,"Deservedly confined into this rock,"
1,2,516,PROSPERO,"Who hadst deserved more than a prison."
1,2,517,CALIBAN,"You taught me language; and my profit on’t"
1,2,518,CALIBAN,"Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you"
1,2,519,CALIBAN,"For learning me your language!"
1,2,520,PROSPERO,"Hag-seed, hence!"
1,2,521,PROSPERO,"Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou’rt best,"
1,2,522,PROSPERO,"To answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?"
1,2,523,PROSPERO,"If thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly"
1,2,524,PROSPERO,"What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,"
1,2,525,PROSPERO,"Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,"
1,2,526,PROSPERO,"That beasts shall tremble at thy din."
1,2,527,CALIBAN,"No, pray thee."
1,2,528,CALIBAN,"[_Aside_] I must obey: his art is of such power,"
1,2,529,CALIBAN,"It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,"
1,2,530,CALIBAN,"And make a vassal of him."
1,2,531,PROSPERO,"So, slave; hence!"

1,2,538,PROSPERO,"Courtsied when you have and kiss’d"
1,2,539,PROSPERO,"The wild waves whist:"
1,2,540,PROSPERO,"Foot it featly here and there;"
1,2,541,PROSPERO,"And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear."
1,2,542,STAGE DIRECTION," _Burthen_ [_dispersedly_]. Hark, hark!"
1,2,543,PROSPERO,"Bow-wow."
1,2,544,PROSPERO,"The watch-dogs bark:"
1,2,545,PROSPERO,"Bow-wow."
1,2,546,ARIEL,"Hark, hark! I hear"
1,2,547,ARIEL,"The strain of strutting chanticleer"
1,2,548,ARIEL,"Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow."
1,2,549,FERDINAND,"Where should this music be? i’ th’ air or th’ earth?"
1,2,550,FERDINAND,"It sounds no more: and, sure, it waits upon"
1,2,551,FERDINAND,"Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,"
1,2,552,FERDINAND,"Weeping again the king my father’s wreck,"
1,2,553,FERDINAND,"This music crept by me upon the waters,"
1,2,554,FERDINAND,"Allaying both their fury and my passion"
1,2,555,FERDINAND,"With its sweet air: thence I have follow’d it."
1,2,556,FERDINAND,"Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone."

1,2,568,FERDINAND,"The ditty does remember my drown’d father."
1,2,569,FERDINAND,"This is no mortal business, nor no sound"
1,2,570,FERDINAND,"That the earth owes:--I hear it now above me."
1,2,571,PROSPERO,"The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,"
1,2,572,PROSPERO,"And say what thou seest yond."
1,2,573,MIRANDA,"What is’t? a spirit?"
1,2,574,MIRANDA,"Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,"
1,2,575,MIRANDA,"It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit."
1,2,576,PROSPERO,"No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses"
1,2,577,PROSPERO,"As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest"
1,2,578,PROSPERO,"Was in the wreck; and, but he’s something stain’d"
1,2,579,PROSPERO,"With grief, that’s beauty’s canker, thou mightst call him"
1,2,580,PROSPERO,"A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows,"
1,2,581,PROSPERO,"And strays about to find ’em."
1,2,582,MIRANDA,"I might call him"
1,2,583,MIRANDA,"A thing divine; for nothing natural"
1,2,584,MIRANDA,"I ever saw so noble."
1,2,585,PROSPERO,"[_Aside_] It goes on, I see,"
1,2,586,PROSPERO,"As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I’ll free thee"
1,2,587,PROSPERO,"Within two days for this."
1,2,588,FERDINAND,"Most sure, the goddess"
1,2,589,FERDINAND,"On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer"
1,2,590,FERDINAND,"May know if you remain upon this island;"

1,2,594,FERDINAND,"If you be maid or no?"

1,2,598,FERDINAND,"I am the best of them that speak this speech,"
1,2,599,FERDINAND,"Were I but where ’tis spoken."
1,2,600,PROSPERO,"How? the best?"
1,2,601,PROSPERO,"What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?"
1,2,602,FERDINAND,"A single thing, as I am now, that wonders"
1,2,603,FERDINAND,"To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;"
1,2,604,FERDINAND,"And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,"
1,2,605,FERDINAND,"Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld"
1,2,606,FERDINAND,"The king my father wreck’d."
1,2,607,MIRANDA,"Alack, for mercy!"
1,2,608,FERDINAND,"Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan"
1,2,609,FERDINAND,"And his brave son being twain."
1,2,610,PROSPERO,"[_Aside_] The Duke of Milan"
1,2,611,PROSPERO,"And his more braver daughter could control thee,"
1,2,612,PROSPERO,"If now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight"
1,2,613,PROSPERO,"They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,"
1,2,614,PROSPERO,"I’ll set thee free for this. [_To Fer._] A word, good sir;"
1,2,615,PROSPERO,"I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word."
1,2,616,MIRANDA,"Why speaks my father so ungently? This"
1,2,617,MIRANDA,"Is the third man that e’er I saw; the first"
1,2,618,MIRANDA,"That e’er I sigh’d for: pity move my father"
1,2,619,MIRANDA,"To be inclined my way!"
1,2,620,FERDINAND,"O, if a virgin,"
1,2,621,FERDINAND,"And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you"
1,2,622,FERDINAND,"The queen of Naples."
1,2,623,PROSPERO,"Soft, sir! one word more."
1,2,624,PROSPERO,"[_Aside_] They are both in either’s powers:"

1,2,628,PROSPERO,"That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp"
1,2,629,PROSPERO,"The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself"
1,2,630,PROSPERO,"Upon this island as a spy, to win it"
1,2,631,PROSPERO,"From me, the lord on’t."
1,2,632,FERDINAND,"No, as I am a man."
1,2,633,MIRANDA,"There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:"
1,2,634,MIRANDA,"If the ill spirit have so fair a house,"
1,2,635,MIRANDA,"Good things will strive to dwell with’t."
1,2,636,PROSPERO,"Follow me."

1,2,638,PROSPERO,"I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together:"
1,2,639,PROSPERO,"Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be"
1,2,640,PROSPERO,"The fresh-brook muscles, wither’d roots, and husks"
1,2,641,PROSPERO,"Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow."
1,2,643,FERDINAND,"No; I will resist such entertainment till"

1,2,645,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Draws, and is charmed from moving._"
1,2,646,MIRANDA,"O dear father,"
1,2,647,MIRANDA,"Make not too rash a trial of him, for"
1,2,648,MIRANDA,"He’s gentle, and not fearful."
1,2,649,PROSPERO,"What! I say,"
1,2,650,PROSPERO,"My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;"
1,2,651,PROSPERO,"Who makest a show, but darest not strike, thy conscience"
1,2,652,PROSPERO,"Is so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward;"
1,2,653,PROSPERO,"For I can here disarm thee with this stick"
1,2,654,PROSPERO,"And make thy weapon drop."
1,2,655,MIRANDA,"Beseech you, father."
1,2,656,PROSPERO,"Hence! hang not on my garments."
1,2,657,MIRANDA,"Sir, have pity;"
1,2,658,MIRANDA,"I’ll be his surety."
1,2,659,PROSPERO,"Silence! one word more"
1,2,660,PROSPERO,"Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!"
1,2,661,PROSPERO,"An advocate for an impostor! hush!"
1,2,662,PROSPERO,"Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,"
1,2,663,PROSPERO,"Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!"
1,2,664,PROSPERO,"To the most of men this is a Caliban,"
1,2,665,PROSPERO,"And they to him are angels."
1,2,666,MIRANDA,"My affections"
1,2,667,MIRANDA,"Are, then, most humble; I have no ambition"
1,2,668,MIRANDA,"To see a goodlier man."
1,2,669,PROSPERO,"Come on; obey:"
1,2,670,PROSPERO,"Thy nerves are in their infancy again,"
1,2,671,PROSPERO,"And have no vigour in them."
1,2,672,FERDINAND,"So they are:"
1,2,673,FERDINAND,"My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up."
1,2,674,FERDINAND,"My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,"
1,2,675,FERDINAND,"The wreck of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,"
1,2,676,FERDINAND,"To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,"
1,2,677,FERDINAND,"Might I but through my prison once a day"
1,2,678,FERDINAND,"Behold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth"
1,2,679,FERDINAND,"Let liberty make use of; space enough"
1,2,680,FERDINAND,"Have I in such a prison."
1,2,681,PROSPERO,"[_Aside_] It works. [_To Fer._] Come on."
1,2,682,PROSPERO,"Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! [_To Fer._] Follow me."
1,2,683,PROSPERO,"[_To Ari._] Hark what thou else shalt do me."
1,2,684,MIRANDA,"Be of comfort;"
1,2,685,MIRANDA,"My father’s of a better nature, sir,"
1,2,686,MIRANDA,"Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted"
1,2,687,MIRANDA,"Which now came from him."
1,2,688,PROSPERO,"Thou shalt be as free"
1,2,689,PROSPERO,"As mountain winds: but then exactly do"
1,2,690,PROSPERO,"All points of my command."
1,2,691,ARIEL,"To the syllable."
1,2,692,PROSPERO,"Come, follow. Speak not for him."
1,2,693,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt._"
2,0,694,ACT,"ACT II."
2,1,695,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE I. _Another part of the island._"
2,1,696,STAGE DIRECTION," _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO,"
2,1,697,STAGE DIRECTION," and others._"
2,1,698,GONZALO,"Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,"
2,1,699,GONZALO,"So have we all, of joy; for our escape"
2,1,700,GONZALO,"Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe"
2,1,701,GONZALO,"Is common; every day, some sailor’s wife,"
2,1,702,GONZALO,"The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,"
2,1,703,GONZALO,"Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,"
2,1,704,GONZALO,"I mean our preservation, few in millions"
2,1,705,GONZALO,"Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh"
2,1,706,GONZALO,"Our sorrow with our comfort."
2,1,707,AONSO,"Prithee, peace."
2,1,708,SEBASTIAN,"He receives comfort like cold porridge."
2,1,709,ANTONIO,"The visitor will not give him o’er so."
2,1,710,SEBASTIAN,"Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by"
2,1,711,SEBASTIAN,"and by it will strike."
2,1,712,GONZALO,"Sir,--"
2,1,713,SEBASTIAN,"One: tell."
2,1,714,GONZALO,"When every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d,"
2,1,715,GONZALO,"Comes to the entertainer--"
2,1,716,SEBASTIAN,"A dollar."
2,1,717,GONZALO,"Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken"
2,1,718,GONZALO,"truer than you purposed."
2,1,719,SEBASTIAN,"You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should."
2,1,720,GONZALO,"Therefore, my lord,--"
2,1,721,ANTONIO,"Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!"
2,1,722,AONSO,"I prithee, spare."
2,1,723,GONZALO,"Well, I have done: but yet,--"
2,1,724,SEBASTIAN,"He will be talking."
2,1,725,ANTONIO,"Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first"
2,1,726,ANTONIO,"begins to crow?"
2,1,727,SEBASTIAN,"The old cock."
2,1,728,ANTONIO,"The cockerel."
2,1,729,SEBASTIAN,"Done. The wager?"
2,1,730,ANTONIO,"A laughter."
2,1,731,SEBASTIAN,"A match!"
2,1,732,ADRIAN,"Though this island seem to be desert,--"
2,1,733,SEBASTIAN,"Ha, ha, ha!--So, you’re paid."
2,1,734,ADRIAN,"Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,--"
2,1,735,SEBASTIAN,"Yet,--"
2,1,736,ADRIAN,"Yet,--"
2,1,737,ANTONIO,"He could not miss’t."
2,1,738,ADRIAN,"It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate"
2,1,739,ADRIAN,"temperance."
2,1,740,ANTONIO,"Temperance was a delicate wench."
2,1,741,SEBASTIAN,"Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered."
2,1,742,ADRIAN,"The air breathes upon us here most sweetly."
2,1,743,SEBASTIAN,"As if it had lungs, and rotten ones."
2,1,744,ANTONIO,"Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen."
2,1,745,GONZALO,"Here is every thing advantageous to life."
2,1,746,ANTONIO,"True; save means to live."
2,1,747,SEBASTIAN,"Of that there’s none, or little."
2,1,748,GONZALO,"How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!"
2,1,749,ANTONIO,"The ground, indeed, is tawny."
2,1,750,SEBASTIAN,"With an eye of green in’t."
2,1,751,ANTONIO,"He misses not much."
2,1,752,SEBASTIAN,"No; he doth but mistake the truth totally."
2,1,753,GONZALO,"But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost"
2,1,754,GONZALO,"beyond credit,--"
2,1,755,SEBASTIAN,"As many vouched rarities are."
2,1,756,GONZALO,"That our garments, being, as they were, drenched"
2,1,757,GONZALO,"in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and glosses,"
2,1,758,GONZALO,"being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water."
2,1,759,ANTONIO,"If but one of his pockets could speak, would it"
2,1,760,ANTONIO,"not say he lies?"
2,1,761,SEBASTIAN,"Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report."
2,1,762,GONZALO,"Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when"
2,1,763,GONZALO,"we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s"
2,1,764,GONZALO,"fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis."
2,1,765,SEBASTIAN,"’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in"
2,1,766,SEBASTIAN,"our return."
2,1,767,ADRIAN,"Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon"
2,1,768,ADRIAN,"to their queen."
2,1,769,GONZALO,"Not since widow Dido’s time."
2,1,770,ANTONIO,"Widow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow"
2,1,771,ANTONIO,"in? widow Dido!"
2,1,772,SEBASTIAN,"What if he had said ‘widower Æneas’ too? Good"
2,1,773,SEBASTIAN,"Lord, how you take it!"
2,1,774,ADRIAN,"‘Widow Dido’ said you? you make me study of"
2,1,775,ADRIAN,"that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis."
2,1,776,GONZALO,"This Tunis, sir, was Carthage."
2,1,777,ADRIAN,"Carthage?"
2,1,778,GONZALO,"I assure you, Carthage."
2,1,779,SEBASTIAN,"His word is more than the miraculous harp; he"
2,1,780,SEBASTIAN,"hath raised the wall, and houses too."
2,1,781,ANTONIO,"What impossible matter will he make easy next?"
2,1,782,SEBASTIAN,"I think he will carry this island home in his"
2,1,783,SEBASTIAN,"pocket, and give it his son for an apple."
2,1,784,ANTONIO,"And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring"
2,1,785,ANTONIO,"forth more islands."
2,1,786,GONZALO,"Ay.-"
2,1,787,ANTONIO,"Why, in good time."
2,1,788,GONZALO,"Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now"
2,1,789,GONZALO,"as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your"
2,1,790,GONZALO,"daughter, who is now queen."
2,1,791,ANTONIO,"And the rarest that e’er came there."
2,1,792,SEBASTIAN,"Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido."
2,1,793,ANTONIO,"O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido."
2,1,794,GONZALO,"Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I"
2,1,795,GONZALO,"wore it? I mean, in a sort."
2,1,796,ANTONIO,"That sort was well fished for."
2,1,797,GONZALO,"When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?"
2,1,798,AONSO,"You cram these words into mine ears against"
2,1,799,AONSO,"The stomach of my sense. Would I had never"
2,1,800,AONSO,"Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,"
2,1,801,AONSO,"My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too."
2,1,802,AONSO,"Who is so far from Italy removed"
2,1,803,AONSO,"I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir"
2,1,804,AONSO,"Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish"
2,1,805,AONSO,"Hath made his meal on thee?"
2,1,806,FRANCISCO,"Sir, he may live:"
2,1,807,FRANCISCO,"I saw him beat the surges under him,"
2,1,808,FRANCISCO,"And ride upon their backs; he trod the water."
2,1,809,FRANCISCO,"Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted"
2,1,810,FRANCISCO,"The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head"
2,1,811,FRANCISCO,"’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar’d"
2,1,812,FRANCISCO,"Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke"
2,1,813,FRANCISCO,"To the shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bow’d,"
2,1,814,FRANCISCO,"As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt"
2,1,815,FRANCISCO,"He came alive to land."
2,1,816,AONSO,"No, no, he’s gone."
2,1,817,SEBASTIAN,"Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,"
2,1,818,SEBASTIAN,"That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,"
2,1,819,SEBASTIAN,"But rather lose her to an African;"
2,1,820,SEBASTIAN,"Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,"
2,1,821,SEBASTIAN,"Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t."
2,1,822,AONSO,"Prithee, peace."
2,1,823,SEBASTIAN,"You were kneel’d to, and importuned otherwise,"
2,1,824,SEBASTIAN,"By all of us; and the fair soul herself"
2,1,825,SEBASTIAN,"Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at"
2,1,826,SEBASTIAN,"Which end o’ the beam should bow. We have lost your son,"
2,1,827,SEBASTIAN,"I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have"
2,1,828,SEBASTIAN,"More widows in them of this business’ making"
2,1,829,SEBASTIAN,"Than we bring men to comfort them:"
2,1,830,SEBASTIAN,"The fault’s your own."
2,1,831,AONSO,"So is the dear’st o’ the loss."
2,1,832,GONZALO,"My lord Sebastian,"
2,1,833,GONZALO,"The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,"
2,1,834,GONZALO,"And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,"
2,1,835,GONZALO,"When you should bring the plaster."
2,1,836,SEBASTIAN,"Very well."
2,1,837,ANTONIO,"And most chirurgeonly."
2,1,838,GONZALO,"It is foul weather in us all, good sir,"
2,1,839,GONZALO,"When you are cloudy."
2,1,840,SEBASTIAN,"Foul weather?"
2,1,841,ANTONIO,"Very foul."
2,1,842,GONZALO,"Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--"
2,1,843,ANTONIO,"He’ld sow’t with nettle-seed."
2,1,844,SEBASTIAN,"Or docks, or mallows."
2,1,845,GONZALO,"And were the king on’t, what would I do?"
2,1,846,SEBASTIAN,"’Scape being drunk for want of wine."
2,1,847,GONZALO,"I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries"
2,1,848,GONZALO,"Execute all things; for no kind of traffic"
2,1,849,GONZALO,"Would I admit; no name of magistrate;"
2,1,850,GONZALO,"Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,"
2,1,851,GONZALO,"And use of service, none; contract, succession,"
2,1,852,GONZALO,"Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;"
2,1,853,GONZALO,"No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;"
2,1,854,GONZALO,"No occupation; all men idle, all;"
2,1,855,GONZALO,"And women too, but innocent and pure;"
2,1,856,GONZALO,"No sovereignty;--"
2,1,857,SEBASTIAN,"Yet he would be king on’t."
2,1,858,ANTONIO,"The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the"
2,1,859,ANTONIO,"beginning."
2,1,860,GONZALO,"All things in common nature should produce"
2,1,861,GONZALO,"Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,"
2,1,862,GONZALO,"Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,"
2,1,863,GONZALO,"Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,"
2,1,864,GONZALO,"Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,"
2,1,865,GONZALO,"To feed my innocent people."
2,1,866,SEBASTIAN,"No marrying ’mong his subjects?"
2,1,867,ANTONIO,"None, man; all idle; whores and knaves."
2,1,868,GONZALO,"I would with such perfection govern, sir,"
2,1,869,GONZALO,"To excel the golden age."
2,1,870,SEBASTIAN,"’Save his majesty!"
2,1,871,ANTONIO,"Long live Gonzalo!"
2,1,872,GONZALO,"And,--do you mark me, sir?"
2,1,873,AONSO,"Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me."
2,1,874,GONZALO,"I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister"
2,1,875,GONZALO,"occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible"
2,1,876,GONZALO,"and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing."
2,1,877,ANTONIO,"’Twas you we laughed at."
2,1,878,GONZALO,"Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to"
2,1,879,GONZALO,"you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still."
2,1,880,ANTONIO,"What a blow was there given!"
2,1,881,SEBASTIAN,"An it had not fallen flat-long."
2,1,882,GONZALO,"You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would"
2,1,883,GONZALO,"lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it"
2,1,884,GONZALO,"five weeks without changing."
2,1,885,STAGE DIRECTION," _Enter ARIEL (invisible) playing solemn music._"
2,1,886,SEBASTIAN,"We would so, and then go a bat-fowling."
2,1,887,ANTONIO,"Nay, good my lord, be not angry."
2,1,888,GONZALO,"No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion"
2,1,889,GONZALO,"so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very"
2,1,890,GONZALO,"heavy?"
2,1,891,ANTONIO,"Go sleep, and hear us."
2,1,892,STAGE DIRECTION,"  [_All sleep except Alon., Seb., and Ant._"
2,1,893,AONSO,"What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes"
2,1,894,AONSO,"Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find"
2,1,895,AONSO,"They are inclined to do so."
2,1,896,SEBASTIAN,"Please you, sir,"
2,1,897,SEBASTIAN,"Do not omit the heavy offer of it:"
2,1,898,SEBASTIAN,"It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,"
2,1,899,SEBASTIAN,"It is a comforter."
2,1,900,ANTONIO,"We two, my lord,"
2,1,901,ANTONIO,"Will guard your person while you take your rest,"
2,1,902,ANTONIO,"And watch your safety."
2,1,903,AONSO,"Thank you.--Wondrous heavy."
2,1,904,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._"
2,1,905,SEBASTIAN,"What a strange drowsiness possesses them!"
2,1,906,ANTONIO,"It is the quality o’ the climate."
2,1,908,SEBASTIAN,"Why doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not"
2,1,909,SEBASTIAN,"Myself disposed to sleep."
2,1,910,ANTONIO,"Nor I; my spirits are nimble."
2,1,911,ANTONIO,"They fell together all, as by consent;"
2,1,912,ANTONIO,"They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,"
2,1,913,ANTONIO,"Worthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:--"
2,1,914,ANTONIO,"And yet methinks I see it in thy face,"
2,1,915,ANTONIO,"What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee; and"
2,1,916,ANTONIO,"My strong imagination sees a crown"
2,1,917,ANTONIO,"Dropping upon thy head."
2,1,918,SEBASTIAN,"What, art thou waking?"
2,1,919,ANTONIO,"Do you not hear me speak?"
2,1,920,SEBASTIAN,"I do; and surely"
2,1,921,SEBASTIAN,"It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st"
2,1,922,SEBASTIAN,"Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?"
2,1,923,SEBASTIAN,"This is a strange repose, to be asleep"
2,1,924,SEBASTIAN,"With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,"
2,1,925,SEBASTIAN,"And yet so fast asleep."
2,1,926,ANTONIO,"Noble Sebastian,"
2,1,927,ANTONIO,"Thou let’st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink’st"
2,1,928,ANTONIO,"Whiles thou art waking."
2,1,929,SEBASTIAN,"Thou dost snore distinctly;"
2,1,930,SEBASTIAN,"There’s meaning in thy snores."
2,1,931,ANTONIO,"I am more serious than my custom: you"
2,1,932,ANTONIO,"Must be so too, if heed me; which to do"
2,1,933,ANTONIO,"Trebles thee o’er."
2,1,934,SEBASTIAN,"Well, I am standing water."
2,1,935,ANTONIO,"I’ll teach you how to flow."
2,1,936,SEBASTIAN,"Do so: to ebb"
2,1,937,SEBASTIAN,"Hereditary sloth instructs me."
2,1,938,ANTONIO,"O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish"
2,1,939,ANTONIO,"Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,"
2,1,940,ANTONIO,"You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,"
2,1,941,ANTONIO,"Most often do so near the bottom run"
2,1,942,ANTONIO,"By their own fear or sloth."
2,1,943,SEBASTIAN,"Prithee, say on:"
2,1,944,SEBASTIAN,"The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim"
2,1,945,SEBASTIAN,"A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,"
2,1,946,SEBASTIAN,"Which throes thee much to yield."
2,1,947,ANTONIO,"Thus, sir:"
2,1,948,ANTONIO,"Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,"
2,1,949,ANTONIO,"Who shall be of as little memory"
2,1,950,ANTONIO,"When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,--"
2,1,951,ANTONIO,"For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only"
2,1,952,ANTONIO,"Professes to persuade,--the king his son’s alive,"
2,1,953,ANTONIO,"’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d"
2,1,954,ANTONIO,"As he that sleeps here swims."
2,1,955,SEBASTIAN,"I have no hope"
2,1,956,SEBASTIAN,"That he’s undrown’d."
2,1,957,ANTONIO,"O, out of that ‘no hope’"
2,1,958,ANTONIO,"What great hope have you! no hope that way is"
2,1,959,ANTONIO,"Another way so high a hope that even"
2,1,960,ANTONIO,"Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,"
2,1,961,ANTONIO,"But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me"
2,1,962,ANTONIO,"That Ferdinand is drown’d?"
2,1,963,SEBASTIAN,"He’s gone."
2,1,964,ANTONIO,"Then, tell me,"
2,1,965,ANTONIO,"Who’s the next heir of Naples?"
2,1,966,SEBASTIAN,"Claribel."
2,1,967,ANTONIO,"She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells"
2,1,968,ANTONIO,"Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples"
2,1,969,ANTONIO,"Can have no note, unless the sun were post,--"
2,1,970,ANTONIO,"The man i’ the moon’s too slow,--till new-born chins"
2,1,971,ANTONIO,"Be rough and razorable; she that from whom"
2,1,972,ANTONIO,"We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,"
2,1,973,ANTONIO,"And by that destiny, to perform an act"
2,1,974,ANTONIO,"Whereof what’s past is prologue; what to come,"
2,1,975,ANTONIO,"In yours and my discharge."
2,1,976,SEBASTIAN,"What stuff is this! How say you?"
2,1,977,SEBASTIAN,"’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s queen of Tunis;"
2,1,978,SEBASTIAN,"So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions"
2,1,979,SEBASTIAN,"There is some space."
2,1,980,ANTONIO,"A space whose every cubit"
2,1,981,ANTONIO,"Seems to cry out, “How shall that Claribel"
2,1,982,ANTONIO,"Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,"
2,1,983,ANTONIO,"And let Sebastian wake.” Say, this were death"
2,1,984,ANTONIO,"That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse"
2,1,985,ANTONIO,"Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples"
2,1,986,ANTONIO,"As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate"
2,1,987,ANTONIO,"As amply and unnecessarily"
2,1,988,ANTONIO,"As this Gonzalo; I myself could make"
2,1,989,ANTONIO,"A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore"
2,1,990,ANTONIO,"The mind that I do! what a sleep were this"
2,1,991,ANTONIO,"For your advancement! Do you understand me?"
2,1,992,SEBASTIAN,"Methinks I do."
2,1,993,ANTONIO,"And how does your content"
2,1,994,ANTONIO,"Tender your own good fortune?"
2,1,995,SEBASTIAN,"I remember"
2,1,996,SEBASTIAN,"You did supplant your brother Prospero."
2,1,997,ANTONIO,"True:"
2,1,998,ANTONIO,"And look how well my garments sit upon me;"
2,1,999,ANTONIO,"Much feater than before: my brother’s servants"
2,1,1000,ANTONIO,"Were then my fellows; now they are my men."
2,1,1001,SEBASTIAN,"But for your conscience."
2,1,1002,ANTONIO,"Ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe,"
2,1,1003,ANTONIO,"’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not"
2,1,1004,ANTONIO,"This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,"
2,1,1005,ANTONIO,"That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they,"
2,1,1006,ANTONIO,"And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,"
2,1,1007,ANTONIO,"No better than the earth he lies upon,"

2,2,1096,TRINCULO,"smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind"
2,2,1097,TRINCULO,"of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I"
2,2,1098,TRINCULO,"in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish"
2,2,1099,TRINCULO,"painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of"
2,2,1100,TRINCULO,"silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange"
2,2,1101,TRINCULO,"beast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to"
2,2,1102,TRINCULO,"relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead"
2,2,1103,TRINCULO,"Indian. Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm"
2,2,1104,TRINCULO,"o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no"
2,2,1105,TRINCULO,"longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately"

2,2,1188,STEPHANO,"swear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither. I escaped"
2,2,1189,STEPHANO,"upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o’erboard, by"
2,2,1190,STEPHANO,"this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine"

3,2,1436,CALIBAN,"Yea, yea, my lord: I’ll yield him thee asleep,"
3,2,1437,CALIBAN,"Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head."

3,2,1463,CALIBAN,"I’ll beat him too."
3,2,1464,STEPHANO,"Stand farther. Come, proceed."
3,2,1465,CALIBAN,"Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him"
3,2,1466,CALIBAN,"I’ th’ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,"
3,2,1467,CALIBAN,"Having first seized his books; or with a log"
3,2,1468,CALIBAN,"Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,"
3,2,1469,CALIBAN,"Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember"
3,2,1470,CALIBAN,"First to possess his books; for without them"
3,2,1471,CALIBAN,"He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not"
3,2,1472,CALIBAN,"One spirit to command: they all do hate him"

3,2,1474,CALIBAN,"He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--"
3,2,1475,CALIBAN,"Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal."
3,2,1476,CALIBAN,"And that most deeply to consider is"
3,2,1477,CALIBAN,"The beauty of his daughter; he himself"

3,2,1481,CALIBAN,"As great’st does least."
3,2,1482,STEPHANO,"Is it so brave a lass?"
3,2,1483,CALIBAN,"Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,"

3,2,1485,STEPHANO,"Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I"
3,2,1486,STEPHANO,"will be king and queen,--save our Graces!--and Trinculo"
3,2,1487,STEPHANO,"and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,"
3,2,1488,STEPHANO,"Trinculo?"
3,2,1489,TRINCULO,"Excellent."
3,2,1490,STEPHANO,"Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,"
3,2,1491,STEPHANO,"while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head."
3,2,1492,CALIBAN,"Within this half hour will he be asleep:"
3,2,1493,CALIBAN,"Wilt thou destroy him then?"
3,2,1494,STEPHANO,"Ay, on mine honour."
3,2,1495,ARIEL,"This will I tell my master."
3,2,1496,CALIBAN,"Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:"
3,2,1497,CALIBAN,"Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch"
3,2,1498,CALIBAN,"You taught me but while-ere?"
3,2,1499,STEPHANO,"At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any"

3,2,1501,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Sings._"

3,2,1506,STEPHANO,"What is this same?"
3,2,1507,TRINCULO,"This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture"
3,2,1508,TRINCULO,"of Nobody."
3,2,1509,STEPHANO,"If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:"
3,2,1510,STEPHANO,"if thou beest a devil, take’t as thou list."
3,2,1511,TRINCULO,"O, forgive me my sins!"
3,2,1512,STEPHANO,"He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy"
3,2,1513,STEPHANO,"upon us!"
3,2,1514,CALIBAN,"Art thou afeard?"
3,2,1515,STEPHANO,"No, monster, not I."
3,2,1516,CALIBAN,"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,"
3,2,1517,CALIBAN,"Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not."
3,2,1518,CALIBAN,"Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments"
3,2,1519,CALIBAN,"Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,"
3,2,1520,CALIBAN,"That, if I then had waked after long sleep,"
3,2,1521,CALIBAN,"Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,"
3,2,1522,CALIBAN,"The clouds methought would open, and show riches"
3,2,1523,CALIBAN,"Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,"
3,2,1524,CALIBAN,"I cried to dream again."
3,2,1525,STEPHANO,"This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I"

3,2,1527,CALIBAN,"When Prospero is destroyed."
3,2,1528,STEPHANO,"That shall be by and by: I remember the story."

3,2,1530,TRINCULO,"after do our work."
3,2,1531,STEPHANO,"Lead, monster; we’ll follow. I would I could see"

4,1,1688,PROSPERO,"Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,"
4,1,1689,PROSPERO,"I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,"
4,1,1690,PROSPERO,"Do not smile at me that I boast her off,"
4,1,1691,PROSPERO,"For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,"

4,1,1695,PROSPERO,"Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition"

4,1,1742,PROSPERO,"Or else, good night your vow!"
4,1,1743,FERDINAND,"I warrant you, sir;"
4,1,1744,FERDINAND,"The white cold virgin snow upon my heart"
4,1,1745,FERDINAND,"Abates the ardour of my liver."
4,1,1746,PROSPERO,"Well."
4,1,1747,PROSPERO,"Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,"

4,1,1829,PROSPERO,"Or else our spell is marr’d."
4,1,1830,IRIS,"You nymphs, call’d Naiads, of the windring brooks,"
4,1,1831,IRIS,"With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,"

4,1,1846,PROSPERO,"[_Aside_] I had forgot that foul conspiracy"

4,1,1852,MIRANDA,"Never till this day"
4,1,1853,MIRANDA,"Saw I him touch’d with anger so distemper’d."

4,1,1855,PROSPERO,"As if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir."
4,1,1856,PROSPERO,"Our revels now are ended. These our actors,"
4,1,1857,PROSPERO,"As I foretold you, were all spirits, and"
4,1,1858,PROSPERO,"Are melted into air, into thin air:"
4,1,1859,PROSPERO,"And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,"
4,1,1860,PROSPERO,"The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,"
4,1,1861,PROSPERO,"The solemn temples, the great globe itself,"
4,1,1862,PROSPERO,"Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,"
4,1,1863,PROSPERO,"And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,"
4,1,1864,PROSPERO,"Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff"
4,1,1865,PROSPERO,"As dreams are made on; and our little life"
4,1,1866,PROSPERO,"Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d;"
4,1,1867,PROSPERO,"Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:"
4,1,1868,PROSPERO,"Be not disturb’d with my infirmity:"
4,1,1869,PROSPERO,"If you be pleased, retire into my cell,"
4,1,1870,PROSPERO,"And there repose: a turn or two I’ll walk,"
4,1,1871,PROSPERO,"To still my beating mind."
4,1,1872,MIRANDA,"We wish your peace."

4,1,1878,PROSPERO,"We must prepare to meet with Caliban."
4,1,1879,ARIEL,"Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,"
4,1,1880,ARIEL,"I thought to have told thee of it; but I fear’d"
4,1,1881,ARIEL,"Lest I might anger thee."
4,1,1882,STAGE DIRECTION," Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?"
4,1,1883,ARIEL,"I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;"
4,1,1884,ARIEL,"So full of valour that they smote the air"
4,1,1885,ARIEL,"For breathing in their faces; beat the ground"
4,1,1886,ARIEL,"For kissing of their feet; yet always bending"
4,1,1887,ARIEL,"Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor;"
4,1,1888,ARIEL,"At which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,"
4,1,1889,ARIEL,"Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses"
4,1,1890,ARIEL,"As they smelt music: so I charm’d their ears,"
4,1,1891,ARIEL,"That, calf-like, they my lowing follow’d through"
4,1,1892,ARIEL,"Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,"
4,1,1893,ARIEL,"Which enter’d their frail shins: at last I left them"
4,1,1894,ARIEL,"I’ the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,"
4,1,1895,ARIEL,"There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake"
4,1,1896,ARIEL,"O’erstunk their feet."
4,1,1897,PROSPERO,"This was well done, my bird."
4,1,1898,PROSPERO,"Thy shape invisible retain thou still:"
4,1,1899,PROSPERO,"The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,"
4,1,1900,PROSPERO,"For stale to catch these thieves."
4,1,1901,ARIEL,"I go, I go."
4,1,1902,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit._"
4,1,1903,STAGE DIRECTION," A devil, a born devil, on whose nature"

4,1,1906,PROSPERO,"And as with age his body uglier grows,"
4,1,1907,PROSPERO,"So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,"

4,1,1915,STEPHANO,"Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless"
4,1,1916,STEPHANO,"fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us."
4,1,1917,TRINCULO,"Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my"
4,1,1918,TRINCULO,"nose is in great indignation."
4,1,1919,STEPHANO,"So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should"
4,1,1920,STEPHANO,"take a displeasure against you, look you,--"
4,1,1921,TRINCULO,"Thou wert but a lost monster."
4,1,1922,CALIBAN,"Good my lord, give me thy favour still."
4,1,1923,CALIBAN,"Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to"
4,1,1924,CALIBAN,"Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly."
4,1,1925,CALIBAN,"All’s hush’d as midnight yet."
4,1,1926,TRINCULO,"Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--"
4,1,1927,STEPHANO,"There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,"
4,1,1928,STEPHANO,"monster, but an infinite loss."
4,1,1929,TRINCULO,"That’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is"
4,1,1930,TRINCULO,"your harmless fairy, monster."
4,1,1931,STEPHANO,"I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for"
4,1,1932,STEPHANO,"my labour."
4,1,1933,CALIBAN,"Prithee, my king, be quiet. See’st thou here,"
4,1,1934,CALIBAN,"This is the mouth o’ the cell: no noise, and enter."
4,1,1935,CALIBAN,"Do that good mischief which may make this island"

4,1,1937,CALIBAN,"For aye thy foot-licker."
4,1,1938,STEPHANO,"Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody"

4,1,1940,TRINCULO,"O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!"
4,1,1941,TRINCULO,"look what a wardrobe here is for thee!"
4,1,1942,CALIBAN,"Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash."
4,1,1943,TRINCULO,"O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery."
4,1,1944,TRINCULO,"O King Stephano!"
4,1,1945,STEPHANO,"Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I’ll"

5,1,2269,BOATSWAIN,"If I did think, sir, I were well awake,"
5,1,2270,BOATSWAIN,"I’ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,"
5,1,2271,BOATSWAIN,"And--how we know not--all clapp’d under hatches;"
5,1,2272,BOATSWAIN,"Where, but even now, with strange and several noises"
5,1,2273,BOATSWAIN,"Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,"
5,1,2274,BOATSWAIN,"And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,"
5,1,2275,BOATSWAIN,"We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;"
5,1,2276,BOATSWAIN,"Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld"
5,1,2277,BOATSWAIN,"Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master"
5,1,2278,BOATSWAIN,"Capering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you,"
5,1,2279,BOATSWAIN,"Even in a dream, were we divided from them,"
5,1,2280,BOATSWAIN,"And were brought moping hither."
5,1,2281,ARIEL,"[_Aside to Pros._] Was’t well done?"
5,1,2282,PROSPERO,"[_Aside to Ari._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free."
5,1,2283,AONSO,"This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod;"
5,1,2284,AONSO,"And there is in this business more than nature"
5,1,2285,AONSO,"Was ever conduct of: some oracle"
5,1,2286,AONSO,"Must rectify our knowledge."
5,1,2287,PROSPERO,"Sir, my liege,"
5,1,2288,PROSPERO,"Do not infest your mind with beating on"
5,1,2289,PROSPERO,"The strangeness of this business; at pick’d leisure"
5,1,2290,PROSPERO,"Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,"
5,1,2291,PROSPERO,"Which to you shall seem probable, of every"
5,1,2292,PROSPERO,"These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful,"
5,1,2293,PROSPERO,"And think of each thing well."
5,1,2294,PROSPERO,"[_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit:"
5,1,2295,PROSPERO,"Set Caliban and his companions free;"
5,1,2296,PROSPERO,"Untie the spell."
5,1,2297,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit Ariel._]"
5,1,2298,PROSPERO,"How fares my gracious sir?"
5,1,2299,PROSPERO,"There are yet missing of your company"
5,1,2300,PROSPERO,"Some few odd lads that you remember not."
5,1,2301,STAGE DIRECTION," _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO,"
5,1,2302,STAGE DIRECTION," in their stolen apparel._"
5,1,2303,STEPHANO,"Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man"
5,1,2304,STEPHANO,"take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio,"
5,1,2305,STEPHANO,"bully-monster, coragio!"
5,1,2306,TRINCULO,"If these be true spies which I wear in my head,"
5,1,2307,TRINCULO,"here’s a goodly sight."
5,1,2308,CALIBAN,"O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!"
5,1,2309,CALIBAN,"How fine my master is! I am afraid"
5,1,2310,CALIBAN,"He will chastise me."
5,1,2311,SEBASTIAN,"Ha, ha!"
5,1,2312,SEBASTIAN,"What things are these, my lord Antonio?"
5,1,2313,SEBASTIAN,"Will money buy ’em?"
5,1,2314,ANTONIO,"Very like; one of them"
5,1,2315,ANTONIO,"Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable."
5,1,2316,PROSPERO,"Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,"
5,1,2317,PROSPERO,"Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,"
5,1,2318,PROSPERO,"His mother was a witch; and one so strong"
5,1,2319,PROSPERO,"That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,"
5,1,2320,PROSPERO,"And deal in her command, without her power."
5,1,2321,PROSPERO,"These three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil--"
5,1,2322,PROSPERO,"For he’s a bastard one--had plotted with them"
5,1,2323,PROSPERO,"To take my life. Two of these fellows you"
5,1,2324,PROSPERO,"Must know and own; this thing of darkness I"
5,1,2325,PROSPERO,"Acknowledge mine."
5,1,2326,CALIBAN,"I shall be pinch’d to death."
5,1,2327,AONSO,"Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?"
5,1,2328,SEBASTIAN,"He is drunk now: where had he wine?"
5,1,2329,AONSO,"And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they"
5,1,2330,AONSO,"Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?--"
5,1,2331,AONSO,"How camest thou in this pickle?"
5,1,2332,TRINCULO,"I have been in such a pickle, since I saw you"
5,1,2333,TRINCULO,"last, that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not"
5,1,2334,TRINCULO,"fear fly-blowing."
5,1,2335,SEBASTIAN,"Why, how now, Stephano!"
5,1,2336,STEPHANO,"O, touch me not;--I am not Stephano, but a cramp."
5,1,2337,PROSPERO,"You’ld be king o’ the isle, sirrah?"
5,1,2338,STEPHANO,"I should have been a sore one, then."
5,1,2339,AONSO,"This is a strange thing as e’er I look’d on."
5,1,2340,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Pointing to Caliban._"
5,1,2341,PROSPERO,"He is as disproportion’d in his manners"
5,1,2342,PROSPERO,"As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;"
5,1,2343,PROSPERO,"Take with you your companions; as you look"
5,1,2344,PROSPERO,"To have my pardon, trim it handsomely."
5,1,2345,CALIBAN,"Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,"
5,1,2346,CALIBAN,"And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass"
5,1,2347,CALIBAN,"Was I, to take this drunkard for a god,"
5,1,2348,CALIBAN,"And worship this dull fool!"
5,1,2349,PROSPERO,"Go to; away!"
5,1,2350,AONSO,"Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it."
5,1,2351,SEBASTIAN,"Or stole it, rather."
5,1,2352,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin._"
5,1,2353,PROSPERO,"Sir, I invite your Highness and your train"
5,1,2354,PROSPERO,"To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest"
5,1,2355,PROSPERO,"For this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste"
5,1,2356,PROSPERO,"With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it"
5,1,2357,PROSPERO,"Go quick away: the story of my life,"
5,1,2358,PROSPERO,"And the particular accidents gone by"
5,1,2359,PROSPERO,"Since I came to this isle: and in the morn"
5,1,2360,PROSPERO,"I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,"
5,1,2361,PROSPERO,"Where I have hope to see the nuptial"
5,1,2362,PROSPERO,"Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;"
5,1,2363,PROSPERO,"And thence retire me to my Milan, where"
5,1,2364,PROSPERO,"Every third thought shall be my grave."
5,1,2365,AONSO,"I long"
5,1,2366,AONSO,"To hear the story of your life, which must"
5,1,2367,AONSO,"Take the ear strangely."
5,1,2368,PROSPERO,"I’ll deliver all;"
5,1,2369,PROSPERO,"And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,"
5,1,2370,PROSPERO,"And sail so expeditious, that shall catch"
5,1,2371,PROSPERO,"Your royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ari._] My Ariel, chick,"
5,1,2372,PROSPERO,"That is thy charge: then to the elements"
5,1,2373,PROSPERO,"Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near."
5,1,2374,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt._"
6,0,2375,ACT,"EPILOGUE."
6,0,2376,PROSPERO,"Now my charms are all o’erthrown,"
6,0,2377,PROSPERO,"And what strength I have’s mine own,"
6,0,2378,PROSPERO,"Which is most faint: now, ’tis true,"
6,0,2379,PROSPERO,"I must be here confined by you,"
6,0,2380,PROSPERO,"Or sent to Naples. Let me not,"
6,0,2381,PROSPERO,"Since I have my dukedom got,"
6,0,2382,PROSPERO,"And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell"
6,0,2383,PROSPERO,"In this bare island by your spell;"
6,0,2384,PROSPERO,"But release me from my bands"
6,0,2385,PROSPERO,"With the help of your good hands:"
6,0,2386,PROSPERO,"Gentle breath of yours my sails"
6,0,2387,PROSPERO,"Must fill, or else my project fails,"
6,0,2388,PROSPERO,"Which was to please. Now I want"
6,0,2389,PROSPERO,"Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;"
6,0,2390,PROSPERO,"And my ending is despair,"
6,0,2391,PROSPERO,"Unless I be relieved by prayer,"
6,0,2392,PROSPERO,"Which pierces so, that it assaults"
6,0,2393,PROSPERO,"Mercy itself, and frees all faults."
6,0,2394,PROSPERO,"As you from crimes would pardon’d be,"
6,0,2395,PROSPERO,"Let your indulgence set me free."
