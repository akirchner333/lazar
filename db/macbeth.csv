1,3,232,MACBETH,"Promis’d no less to them?"
1,3,233,BANQUO,"That, trusted home,"
1,3,234,BANQUO,"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"

1,3,249,MACBETH,"Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,"
1,3,250,MACBETH,"And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,"
1,3,251,MACBETH,"Against the use of nature? Present fears"
1,3,252,MACBETH,"Are less than horrible imaginings."
1,3,253,MACBETH,"My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,"
1,3,254,MACBETH,"Shakes so my single state of man"

2,2,680,MACBETH,"But they did say their prayers, and address’d them"
2,2,681,MACBETH,"Again to sleep."
2,2,682,LADY MACBETH,"There are two lodg’d together."
2,2,683,MACBETH,"One cried, “God bless us!” and, “Amen,” the other,"
2,2,684,MACBETH,"As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands."
2,2,685,MACBETH,"List’ning their fear, I could not say “Amen,”"
2,2,686,MACBETH,"When they did say, “God bless us.”"
2,2,687,LADY MACBETH,"Consider it not so deeply."
2,2,688,MACBETH,"But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?"
2,2,689,MACBETH,"I had most need of blessing, and “Amen”"
2,2,690,MACBETH,"Stuck in my throat."
2,2,691,LADY MACBETH,"These deeds must not be thought"
2,2,692,LADY MACBETH,"After these ways; so, it will make us mad."
2,2,693,MACBETH,"Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!"
2,2,694,MACBETH,"Macbeth does murder sleep,”—the innocent sleep;"
2,2,695,MACBETH,"Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,"
2,2,696,MACBETH,"The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath,"
2,2,697,MACBETH,"Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,"
2,2,698,MACBETH,"Chief nourisher in life’s feast."
2,2,699,LADY MACBETH,"What do you mean?"
2,2,700,MACBETH,"Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house:"
2,2,701,MACBETH,"“Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdor"
2,2,702,MACBETH,"Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!”"
2,2,703,LADY MACBETH,"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,"
2,2,704,LADY MACBETH,"You do unbend your noble strength to think"
2,2,705,LADY MACBETH,"So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,"
2,2,706,LADY MACBETH,"And wash this filthy witness from your hand.—"
2,2,707,LADY MACBETH,"Why did you bring these daggers from the place?"
2,2,708,LADY MACBETH,"They must lie there: go carry them, and smear"
2,2,709,LADY MACBETH,"The sleepy grooms with blood."
2,2,710,MACBETH,"I’ll go no more:"
2,2,711,MACBETH,"I am afraid to think what I have done;"
2,2,712,MACBETH,"Look on’t again I dare not."
2,2,713,LADY MACBETH,"Infirm of purpose!"
2,2,714,LADY MACBETH,"Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead"
2,2,715,LADY MACBETH,"Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood"
2,2,716,LADY MACBETH,"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,"
2,2,717,LADY MACBETH,"I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,"
2,2,718,LADY MACBETH,"For it must seem their guilt."
2,2,719,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit. Knocking within._]"
2,2,720,MACBETH,"Whence is that knocking?"
2,2,721,MACBETH,"How is’t with me, when every noise appals me?"
2,2,722,MACBETH,"What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!"
2,2,723,MACBETH,"Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood"
2,2,724,MACBETH,"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather"
2,2,725,MACBETH,"The multitudinous seas incarnadine,"
2,2,726,MACBETH,"Making the green one red."
2,2,727,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Lady Macbeth."
2,2,728,LADY MACBETH,"My hands are of your color, but I shame"
2,2,729,LADY MACBETH,"To wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knocking"
2,2,730,LADY MACBETH,"At the south entry:—retire we to our chamber."
2,2,731,LADY MACBETH,"A little water clears us of this deed:"
2,2,732,LADY MACBETH,"How easy is it then! Your constancy"
2,2,733,LADY MACBETH,"Hath left you unattended.—[_Knocking within._] Hark, more knocking."
2,2,734,LADY MACBETH,"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us"
2,2,735,LADY MACBETH,"And show us to be watchers. Be not lost"
2,2,736,LADY MACBETH,"So poorly in your thoughts."
2,2,737,MACBETH,"To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._]"
2,2,738,MACBETH,"Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!"
2,2,739,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt._]"
2,3,740,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE III. The same."
2,3,741,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter a Porter. Knocking within."
2,3,742,PORTER,"Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should"
2,3,743,PORTER,"have old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock. Who’s"
2,3,744,PORTER,"there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on"
2,3,745,PORTER,"the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;"
2,3,746,PORTER,"here you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’"
2,3,747,PORTER,"th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear"
2,3,748,PORTER,"in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough"
2,3,749,PORTER,"for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in,"
2,3,750,PORTER,"equivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith,"
2,3,751,PORTER,"here’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French"
2,3,752,PORTER,"hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]"
2,3,753,PORTER,"Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold"
2,3,754,PORTER,"for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in"
2,3,755,PORTER,"some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting"
2,3,756,PORTER,"bonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter."
2,3,757,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Opens the gate._]"
2,3,758,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macduff and Lennox."
2,3,759,MACDUFF,"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,"
2,3,760,MACDUFF,"That you do lie so late?"
2,3,761,PORTER,"Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is"
2,3,762,PORTER,"a great provoker of three things."
2,3,763,MACDUFF,"What three things does drink especially provoke?"
2,3,764,PORTER,"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes"
2,3,765,PORTER,"and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the"
2,3,766,PORTER,"performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with"
2,3,767,PORTER,"lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes"
2,3,768,PORTER,"him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and"
2,3,769,PORTER,"not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him"
2,3,770,PORTER,"the lie, leaves him."
2,3,771,MACDUFF,"I believe drink gave thee the lie last night."
2,3,772,PORTER,"That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his"
2,3,773,PORTER,"lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs"
2,3,774,PORTER,"sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him."
2,3,775,MACDUFF,"Is thy master stirring?"
2,3,776,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macbeth."
2,3,777,MACDUFF,"Our knocking has awak’d him; here he comes."
2,3,778,LENNOX,"Good morrow, noble sir!"
2,3,779,MACBETH,"Good morrow, both!"
2,3,780,MACDUFF,"Is the King stirring, worthy thane?"
2,3,781,MACBETH,"Not yet."
2,3,782,MACDUFF,"He did command me to call timely on him."
2,3,783,MACDUFF,"I have almost slipp’d the hour."
2,3,784,MACBETH,"I’ll bring you to him."
2,3,785,MACDUFF,"I know this is a joyful trouble to you;"
2,3,786,MACDUFF,"But yet ’tis one."
2,3,787,MACBETH,"The labour we delight in physics pain."
2,3,788,MACBETH,"This is the door."
2,3,789,MACDUFF,"I’ll make so bold to call."
2,3,790,MACDUFF,"For ’tis my limited service."
2,3,791,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit Macduff._]"
2,3,792,LENNOX,"Goes the King hence today?"
2,3,793,MACBETH,"He does. He did appoint so."
2,3,794,LENNOX,"The night has been unruly: where we lay,"
2,3,795,LENNOX,"Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,"
2,3,796,LENNOX,"Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death,"
2,3,797,LENNOX,"And prophesying, with accents terrible,"
2,3,798,LENNOX,"Of dire combustion and confus’d events,"
2,3,799,LENNOX,"New hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird"
2,3,800,LENNOX,"Clamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth"
2,3,801,LENNOX,"Was feverous, and did shake."
2,3,802,MACBETH,"’Twas a rough night."
2,3,803,LENNOX,"My young remembrance cannot parallel"
2,3,804,LENNOX,"A fellow to it."
2,3,805,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macduff."
2,3,806,MACDUFF,"O horror, horror, horror!"
2,3,807,MACDUFF,"Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!"
2,3,808,MACBETH, LENNOX,"What’s the matter?"
2,3,809,MACDUFF,"Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!"
2,3,810,MACDUFF,"Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope"
2,3,811,MACDUFF,"The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence"
2,3,812,MACDUFF,"The life o’ th’ building."
2,3,813,MACBETH,"What is’t you say? the life?"
2,3,814,LENNOX,"Mean you his majesty?"
2,3,815,MACDUFF,"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight"
2,3,816,MACDUFF,"With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak."
2,3,817,MACDUFF,"See, and then speak yourselves."
2,3,818,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox._]"
2,3,819,MACDUFF,"Awake, awake!—"
2,3,820,MACDUFF,"Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!"

2,3,822,MACDUFF,"Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit,"
2,3,823,MACDUFF,"And look on death itself! Up, up, and see"
2,3,824,MACDUFF,"The great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo!"
2,3,825,MACDUFF,"As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites"

2,3,829,LADY MACBETH,"What’s the business,"
2,3,830,LADY MACBETH,"That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley"
2,3,831,LADY MACBETH,"The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!"
2,3,832,MACDUFF,"O gentle lady,"
2,3,833,MACDUFF,"’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:"
2,3,834,MACDUFF,"The repetition, in a woman’s ear,"
2,3,835,MACDUFF,"Would murder as it fell."
2,3,836,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Banquo."
2,3,837,MACDUFF,"O Banquo, Banquo!"
2,3,838,MACDUFF,"Our royal master’s murder’d!"
2,3,839,LADY MACBETH,"Woe, alas!"
2,3,840,LADY MACBETH,"What, in our house?"
2,3,841,BANQUO,"Too cruel anywhere.—"
2,3,842,BANQUO,"Dear Duff, I pr’ythee, contradict thyself,"
2,3,843,BANQUO,"And say it is not so."
2,3,844,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross."
2,3,845,MACBETH,"Had I but died an hour before this chance,"
2,3,846,MACBETH,"I had liv’d a blessed time; for, from this instant"
2,3,847,MACBETH,"There’s nothing serious in mortality."
2,3,848,MACBETH,"All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;"
2,3,849,MACBETH,"The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees"
2,3,850,MACBETH,"Is left this vault to brag of."
2,3,851,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Malcolm and Donalbain."
2,3,852,DONALBAIN,"What is amiss?"
2,3,853,MACBETH,"You are, and do not know’t:"
2,3,854,MACBETH,"The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood"
2,3,855,MACBETH,"Is stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d."
2,3,856,MACDUFF,"Your royal father’s murder’d."
2,3,857,MALCOLM,"O, by whom?"
2,3,858,LENNOX,"Those of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t:"
2,3,859,LENNOX,"Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood;"
2,3,860,LENNOX,"So were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found"
2,3,861,LENNOX,"Upon their pillows. They star’d, and were distracted;"
2,3,862,LENNOX,"No man’s life was to be trusted with them."
2,3,863,MACBETH,"O, yet I do repent me of my fury,"
2,3,864,MACBETH,"That I did kill them."
2,3,865,MACDUFF,"Wherefore did you so?"
2,3,866,MACBETH,"Who can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious,"
2,3,867,MACBETH,"Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:"
2,3,868,MACBETH,"Th’ expedition of my violent love"
2,3,869,MACBETH,"Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,"
2,3,870,MACBETH,"His silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;"
2,3,871,MACBETH,"And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature"
2,3,872,MACBETH,"For ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,"
2,3,873,MACBETH,"Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers"
2,3,874,MACBETH,"Unmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,"
2,3,875,MACBETH,"That had a heart to love, and in that heart"
2,3,876,MACBETH,"Courage to make’s love known?"
2,3,877,LADY MACBETH,"Help me hence, ho!"
2,3,878,MACDUFF,"Look to the lady."
2,3,879,MALCOLM,"Why do we hold our tongues,"
2,3,880,MALCOLM,"That most may claim this argument for ours?"
2,3,881,DONALBAIN,"What should be spoken here, where our fate,"
2,3,882,DONALBAIN,"Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?"
2,3,883,DONALBAIN,"Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d."
2,3,884,MALCOLM,"Nor our strong sorrow"
2,3,885,MALCOLM,"Upon the foot of motion."
2,3,886,BANQUO,"Look to the lady:—"
2,3,887,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]"
2,3,888,BANQUO,"And when we have our naked frailties hid,"
2,3,889,BANQUO,"That suffer in exposure, let us meet,"
2,3,890,BANQUO,"And question this most bloody piece of work"
2,3,891,BANQUO,"To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:"
2,3,892,BANQUO,"In the great hand of God I stand; and thence"
2,3,893,BANQUO,"Against the undivulg’d pretence I fight"
2,3,894,BANQUO,"Of treasonous malice."
2,3,895,MACDUFF,"And so do I."
2,3,896,ALL,"So all."
2,3,897,MACBETH,"Let’s briefly put on manly readiness,"
2,3,898,MACBETH,"And meet i’ th’ hall together."
2,3,899,ALL,"Well contented."

2,3,901,MALCOLM,"What will you do? Let’s not consort with them:"
2,3,902,MALCOLM,"To show an unfelt sorrow is an office"
2,3,903,MALCOLM,"Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England."
2,3,904,DONALBAIN,"To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune"
2,3,905,DONALBAIN,"Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,"
2,3,906,DONALBAIN,"There’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood,"
2,3,907,DONALBAIN,"The nearer bloody."
2,3,908,MALCOLM,"This murderous shaft that’s shot"
2,3,909,MALCOLM,"Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way"
2,3,910,MALCOLM,"Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;"
2,3,911,MALCOLM,"And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,"
2,3,912,MALCOLM,"But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft"
2,3,913,MALCOLM,"Which steals itself, when there’s no mercy left."

2,4,919,OLD MAN,"Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night"
2,4,920,OLD MAN,"Hath trifled former knowings."
2,4,921,ROSS,"Ha, good father,"
2,4,922,ROSS,"Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,"
2,4,923,ROSS,"Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock ’tis day,"
2,4,924,ROSS,"And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp."
2,4,925,ROSS,"Is’t night’s predominance, or the day’s shame,"
2,4,926,ROSS,"That darkness does the face of earth entomb,"
2,4,927,ROSS,"When living light should kiss it?"
2,4,928,OLD MAN,"’Tis unnatural,"
2,4,929,OLD MAN,"Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last,"
2,4,930,OLD MAN,"A falcon, towering in her pride of place,"
2,4,931,OLD MAN,"Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d."
2,4,932,ROSS,"And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and certain)"
2,4,933,ROSS,"Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,"
2,4,934,ROSS,"Turn’d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,"
2,4,935,ROSS,"Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make"
2,4,936,ROSS,"War with mankind."
2,4,937,OLD MAN,"’Tis said they eat each other."
2,4,938,ROSS,"They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes,"

2,4,944,ROSS,"Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?"
2,4,945,MACDUFF,"Those that Macbeth hath slain."
2,4,946,ROSS,"Alas, the day!"
2,4,947,ROSS,"What good could they pretend?"
2,4,948,MACDUFF,"They were suborn’d."
2,4,949,MACDUFF,"Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons,"
2,4,950,MACDUFF,"Are stol’n away and fled; which puts upon them"
2,4,951,MACDUFF,"Suspicion of the deed."
2,4,952,ROSS,"’Gainst nature still:"
2,4,953,ROSS,"Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up"
2,4,954,ROSS,"Thine own life’s means!—Then ’tis most like"
2,4,955,ROSS,"The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth."
2,4,956,MACDUFF,"He is already nam’d; and gone to Scone"
2,4,957,MACDUFF,"To be invested."
2,4,958,ROSS,"Where is Duncan’s body?"
2,4,959,MACDUFF,"Carried to Colmekill,"

3,1,1013,MACBETH,"Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,"
3,1,1014,MACBETH,"Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?"
3,1,1015,BANQUO,"Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon’s."
3,1,1016,MACBETH,"I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;"
3,1,1017,MACBETH,"And so I do commend you to their backs."
3,1,1018,MACBETH,"Farewell.—"
3,1,1019,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit Banquo._]"
3,1,1020,MACBETH,"Let every man be master of his time"
3,1,1021,MACBETH,"Till seven at night; to make society"
3,1,1022,MACBETH,"The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself"
3,1,1023,MACBETH,"Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you."
3,1,1024,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, &c._]"
3,1,1025,MACBETH,"Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men"
3,1,1026,MACBETH,"Our pleasure?"
3,1,1027,SERVANT,"They are, my lord, without the palace gate."
3,1,1028,MACBETH,"Bring them before us."
3,1,1029,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit Servant._]"
3,1,1030,MACBETH,"To be thus is nothing,"
3,1,1031,MACBETH,"But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo"
3,1,1032,MACBETH,"Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature"
3,1,1033,MACBETH,"Reigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares;"
3,1,1034,MACBETH,"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,"
3,1,1035,MACBETH,"He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour"
3,1,1036,MACBETH,"To act in safety. There is none but he"
3,1,1037,MACBETH,"Whose being I do fear: and under him"
3,1,1038,MACBETH,"My genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,"
3,1,1039,MACBETH,"Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters"
3,1,1040,MACBETH,"When first they put the name of king upon me,"
3,1,1041,MACBETH,"And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,"
3,1,1042,MACBETH,"They hail’d him father to a line of kings:"
3,1,1043,MACBETH,"Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,"
3,1,1044,MACBETH,"And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,"
3,1,1045,MACBETH,"Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,"
3,1,1046,MACBETH,"No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,"
3,1,1047,MACBETH,"For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;"
3,1,1048,MACBETH,"For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;"
3,1,1049,MACBETH,"Put rancours in the vessel of my peace"
3,1,1050,MACBETH,"Only for them; and mine eternal jewel"
3,1,1051,MACBETH,"Given to the common enemy of man,"
3,1,1052,MACBETH,"To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"
3,1,1053,MACBETH,"Rather than so, come, fate, into the list,"
3,1,1054,MACBETH,"And champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—"
3,1,1055,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Servant with two Murderers."
3,1,1056,MACBETH,"Now go to the door, and stay there till we call."
3,1,1057,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit Servant._]"
3,1,1058,MACBETH,"Was it not yesterday we spoke together?"
3,1,1059,FIRST MURDERER,"It was, so please your Highness."
3,1,1060,MACBETH,"Well then, now"
3,1,1061,MACBETH,"Have you consider’d of my speeches? Know"
3,1,1062,MACBETH,"That it was he, in the times past, which held you"
3,1,1063,MACBETH,"So under fortune, which you thought had been"
3,1,1064,MACBETH,"Our innocent self? This I made good to you"
3,1,1065,MACBETH,"In our last conference, pass’d in probation with you"
3,1,1066,MACBETH,"How you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,"
3,1,1067,MACBETH,"Who wrought with them, and all things else that might"
3,1,1068,MACBETH,"To half a soul and to a notion craz’d"
3,1,1069,MACBETH,"Say, “Thus did Banquo.”"
3,1,1070,FIRST MURDERER,"You made it known to us."
3,1,1071,MACBETH,"I did so; and went further, which is now"
3,1,1072,MACBETH,"Our point of second meeting. Do you find"
3,1,1073,MACBETH,"Your patience so predominant in your nature,"
3,1,1074,MACBETH,"That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,"
3,1,1075,MACBETH,"To pray for this good man and for his issue,"
3,1,1076,MACBETH,"Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,"
3,1,1077,MACBETH,"And beggar’d yours forever?"
3,1,1078,FIRST MURDERER,"We are men, my liege."
3,1,1079,MACBETH,"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;"
3,1,1080,MACBETH,"As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,"
3,1,1081,MACBETH,"Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept"
3,1,1082,MACBETH,"All by the name of dogs: the valu’d file"
3,1,1083,MACBETH,"Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,"
3,1,1084,MACBETH,"The housekeeper, the hunter, every one"
3,1,1085,MACBETH,"According to the gift which bounteous nature"
3,1,1086,MACBETH,"Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive"
3,1,1087,MACBETH,"Particular addition, from the bill"
3,1,1088,MACBETH,"That writes them all alike: and so of men."
3,1,1089,MACBETH,"Now, if you have a station in the file,"
3,1,1090,MACBETH,"Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;"
3,1,1091,MACBETH,"And I will put that business in your bosoms,"
3,1,1092,MACBETH,"Whose execution takes your enemy off,"
3,1,1093,MACBETH,"Grapples you to the heart and love of us,"
3,1,1094,MACBETH,"Who wear our health but sickly in his life,"
3,1,1095,MACBETH,"Which in his death were perfect."
3,1,1096,SECOND MURDERER,"I am one, my liege,"
3,1,1097,SECOND MURDERER,"Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world"
3,1,1098,SECOND MURDERER,"Hath so incens’d that I am reckless what"
3,1,1099,SECOND MURDERER,"I do to spite the world."
3,1,1100,FIRST MURDERER,"And I another,"
3,1,1101,FIRST MURDERER,"So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,"
3,1,1102,FIRST MURDERER,"That I would set my life on any chance,"
3,1,1103,FIRST MURDERER,"To mend it or be rid on’t."
3,1,1104,MACBETH,"Both of you"
3,1,1105,MACBETH,"Know Banquo was your enemy."
3,1,1106,BOTH MURDERERS,"True, my lord."
3,1,1107,MACBETH,"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,"
3,1,1108,MACBETH,"That every minute of his being thrusts"
3,1,1109,MACBETH,"Against my near’st of life; and though I could"
3,1,1110,MACBETH,"With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,"
3,1,1111,MACBETH,"And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,"
3,1,1112,MACBETH,"For certain friends that are both his and mine,"
3,1,1113,MACBETH,"Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall"
3,1,1114,MACBETH,"Who I myself struck down: and thence it is"
3,1,1115,MACBETH,"That I to your assistance do make love,"
3,1,1116,MACBETH,"Masking the business from the common eye"
3,1,1117,MACBETH,"For sundry weighty reasons."
3,1,1118,SECOND MURDERER,"We shall, my lord,"
3,1,1119,SECOND MURDERER,"Perform what you command us."
3,1,1120,FIRST MURDERER,"Though our lives—"
3,1,1121,MACBETH,"Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,"
3,1,1122,MACBETH,"I will advise you where to plant yourselves,"
3,1,1123,MACBETH,"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,"
3,1,1124,MACBETH,"The moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight"
3,1,1125,MACBETH,"And something from the palace; always thought"
3,1,1126,MACBETH,"That I require a clearness. And with him"
3,1,1127,MACBETH,"(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)"
3,1,1128,MACBETH,"Fleance his son, that keeps him company,"
3,1,1129,MACBETH,"Whose absence is no less material to me"
3,1,1130,MACBETH,"Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate"
3,1,1131,MACBETH,"Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart."
3,1,1132,MACBETH,"I’ll come to you anon."
3,1,1133,BOTH MURDERERS,"We are resolv’d, my lord."

3,2,1147,LADY MACBETH,"Naught’s had, all’s spent,"

3,2,1149,LADY MACBETH,"’Tis safer to be that which we destroy,"
3,2,1150,LADY MACBETH,"Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy."
3,2,1151,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macbeth."
3,2,1152,LADY MACBETH,"How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,"
3,2,1153,LADY MACBETH,"Of sorriest fancies your companions making,"
3,2,1154,LADY MACBETH,"Using those thoughts which should indeed have died"
3,2,1155,LADY MACBETH,"With them they think on? Things without all remedy"
3,2,1156,LADY MACBETH,"Should be without regard: what’s done is done."
3,2,1157,MACBETH,"We have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it."
3,2,1158,MACBETH,"She’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice"
3,2,1159,MACBETH,"Remains in danger of her former tooth."
3,2,1160,MACBETH,"But let the frame of things disjoint,"
3,2,1161,MACBETH,"Both the worlds suffer,"
3,2,1162,MACBETH,"Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep"
3,2,1163,MACBETH,"In the affliction of these terrible dreams"
3,2,1164,MACBETH,"That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,"
3,2,1165,MACBETH,"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,"
3,2,1166,MACBETH,"Than on the torture of the mind to lie"
3,2,1167,MACBETH,"In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;"
3,2,1168,MACBETH,"After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;"
3,2,1169,MACBETH,"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,"
3,2,1170,MACBETH,"Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing"

3,4,1270,MACBETH,"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,"
3,4,1271,MACBETH,"As broad and general as the casing air:"
3,4,1272,MACBETH,"But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in"

3,4,1277,MACBETH,"Thanks for that."

3,4,1314,LADY MACBETH,"You shall offend him, and extend his passion."
3,4,1315,LADY MACBETH,"Feed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?"
3,4,1316,MACBETH,"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that"
3,4,1317,MACBETH,"Which might appal the devil."
3,4,1318,LADY MACBETH,"O proper stuff!"
3,4,1319,LADY MACBETH,"This is the very painting of your fear:"
3,4,1320,LADY MACBETH,"This is the air-drawn dagger which you said,"
3,4,1321,LADY MACBETH,"Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts"
3,4,1322,LADY MACBETH,"(Impostors to true fear), would well become"
3,4,1323,LADY MACBETH,"A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,"

3,4,1329,MACBETH,"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.—"
3,4,1330,MACBETH,"If charnel houses and our graves must send"

5,5,2312,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle."
5,5,2313,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers."
5,5,2314,MACBETH,"Hang out our banners on the outward walls;"
5,5,2315,MACBETH,"The cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength"
5,5,2316,MACBETH,"Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie"
5,5,2317,MACBETH,"Till famine and the ague eat them up."
5,5,2318,MACBETH,"Were they not forc’d with those that should be ours,"
5,5,2319,MACBETH,"We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,"
5,5,2320,MACBETH,"And beat them backward home."
5,5,2321,STAGE DIRECTION," [_A cry of women within._]"
5,5,2322,MACBETH,"What is that noise?"
5,5,2323,SEYTON,"It is the cry of women, my good lord."
5,5,2324,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit._]"
5,5,2325,MACBETH,"I have almost forgot the taste of fears."
5,5,2326,MACBETH,"The time has been, my senses would have cool’d"
5,5,2327,MACBETH,"To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair"
5,5,2328,MACBETH,"Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir"
5,5,2329,MACBETH,"As life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;"
5,5,2330,MACBETH,"Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,"
5,5,2331,MACBETH,"Cannot once start me."
5,5,2332,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Seyton."
5,5,2333,MACBETH,"Wherefore was that cry?"
5,5,2334,SEYTON,"The Queen, my lord, is dead."
5,5,2335,MACBETH,"She should have died hereafter."
5,5,2336,MACBETH,"There would have been a time for such a word."
5,5,2337,MACBETH,"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,"
5,5,2338,MACBETH,"Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,"
5,5,2339,MACBETH,"To the last syllable of recorded time;"
5,5,2340,MACBETH,"And all our yesterdays have lighted fools"
5,5,2341,MACBETH,"The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!"
5,5,2342,MACBETH,"Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,"
5,5,2343,MACBETH,"That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,"
5,5,2344,MACBETH,"And then is heard no more: it is a tale"
5,5,2345,MACBETH,"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,"
5,5,2346,MACBETH,"Signifying nothing."
5,5,2347,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter a Messenger."
5,5,2348,MACBETH,"Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly."
5,5,2349,MESSENGER,"Gracious my lord,"
5,5,2350,MESSENGER,"I should report that which I say I saw,"
5,5,2351,MESSENGER,"But know not how to do’t."
5,5,2352,MACBETH,"Well, say, sir."
5,5,2353,MESSENGER,"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,"
5,5,2354,MESSENGER,"I look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,"
5,5,2355,MESSENGER,"The wood began to move."
5,5,2356,MACBETH,"Liar, and slave!"
5,5,2357,MESSENGER,"Let me endure your wrath, if’t be not so."
5,5,2358,MESSENGER,"Within this three mile may you see it coming;"
5,5,2359,MESSENGER,"I say, a moving grove."
5,5,2360,MACBETH,"If thou speak’st false,"
5,5,2361,MACBETH,"Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,"
5,5,2362,MACBETH,"Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,"
5,5,2363,MACBETH,"I care not if thou dost for me as much.—"
5,5,2364,MACBETH,"I pull in resolution; and begin"
5,5,2365,MACBETH,"To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,"
5,5,2366,MACBETH,"That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood"
5,5,2367,MACBETH,"Do come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood"
5,5,2368,MACBETH,"Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—"
5,5,2369,MACBETH,"If this which he avouches does appear,"
5,5,2370,MACBETH,"There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here."
5,5,2371,MACBETH,"I ’gin to be aweary of the sun,"
5,5,2372,MACBETH,"And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—"
5,5,2373,MACBETH,"Ring the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!"
5,5,2374,MACBETH,"At least we’ll die with harness on our back."
5,5,2375,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt._]"
5,6,2376,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle."
5,6,2377,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff and their"
5,6,2378,STAGE DIRECTION," Army, with boughs."
5,6,2379,MALCOLM,"Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down,"
5,6,2380,MALCOLM,"And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,"
5,6,2381,MALCOLM,"Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,"
5,6,2382,MALCOLM,"Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we"
5,6,2383,MALCOLM,"Shall take upon’s what else remains to do,"
5,6,2384,MALCOLM,"According to our order."
5,6,2385,SIWARD,"Fare you well.—"
5,6,2386,SIWARD,"Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,"
5,6,2387,SIWARD,"Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight."
5,6,2388,MACDUFF,"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,"
5,6,2389,MACDUFF,"Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death."

5,7,2391,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain."
5,7,2392,STAGE DIRECTION," Alarums. Enter Macbeth."
5,7,2393,MACBETH,"They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,"
5,7,2394,MACBETH,"But, bear-like I must fight the course.—What’s he"
5,7,2395,MACBETH,"That was not born of woman? Such a one"
5,7,2396,MACBETH,"Am I to fear, or none."
5,7,2397,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter young Siward."
5,7,2398,YOUNG SIWARD,"What is thy name?"
5,7,2399,MACBETH,"Thou’lt be afraid to hear it."
5,7,2400,YOUNG SIWARD,"No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter name"
5,7,2401,YOUNG SIWARD,"Than any is in hell."
5,7,2402,MACBETH,"My name’s Macbeth."
5,7,2403,YOUNG SIWARD,"The devil himself could not pronounce a title"
5,7,2404,YOUNG SIWARD,"More hateful to mine ear."
5,7,2405,MACBETH,"No, nor more fearful."
5,7,2406,YOUNG SIWARD,"Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword"
5,7,2407,YOUNG SIWARD,"I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st."
5,7,2408,STAGE DIRECTION," [_They fight, and young Siward is slain._]"
5,7,2409,MACBETH,"Thou wast born of woman."
5,7,2410,MACBETH,"But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,"
5,7,2411,MACBETH,"Brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born."
5,7,2412,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit._]"
5,7,2413,STAGE DIRECTION," Alarums. Enter Macduff."
5,7,2414,MACDUFF,"That way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!"
5,7,2415,MACDUFF,"If thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine,"
5,7,2416,MACDUFF,"My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still."
5,7,2417,MACDUFF,"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms"
5,7,2418,MACDUFF,"Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,"
5,7,2419,MACDUFF,"Or else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge,"
5,7,2420,MACDUFF,"I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;"
5,7,2421,MACDUFF,"By this great clatter, one of greatest note"
5,7,2422,MACDUFF,"Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!"
5,7,2423,MACDUFF,"And more I beg not."
5,7,2424,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exit. Alarums._]"
5,7,2425,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Malcolm and old Siward."
5,7,2426,SIWARD,"This way, my lord;—the castle’s gently render’d:"
5,7,2427,SIWARD,"The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight;"
5,7,2428,SIWARD,"The noble thanes do bravely in the war,"
5,7,2429,SIWARD,"The day almost itself professes yours,"
5,7,2430,SIWARD,"And little is to do."
5,7,2431,MALCOLM,"We have met with foes"
5,7,2432,MALCOLM,"That strike beside us."
5,7,2433,SIWARD,"Enter, sir, the castle."

5,8,2435,SCENE SETTING,"SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field."
5,8,2436,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macbeth."
5,8,2437,MACBETH,"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die"
5,8,2438,MACBETH,"On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes"
5,8,2439,MACBETH,"Do better upon them."
5,8,2440,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macduff."
5,8,2441,MACDUFF,"Turn, hell-hound, turn!"
5,8,2442,MACBETH,"Of all men else I have avoided thee:"
5,8,2443,MACBETH,"But get thee back; my soul is too much charg’d"
5,8,2444,MACBETH,"With blood of thine already."
5,8,2445,MACDUFF,"I have no words;"
5,8,2446,MACDUFF,"My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain"
5,8,2447,MACDUFF,"Than terms can give thee out!"
5,8,2448,STAGE DIRECTION," [_They fight._]"
5,8,2449,MACBETH,"Thou losest labour:"
5,8,2450,MACBETH,"As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air"
5,8,2451,MACBETH,"With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:"
5,8,2452,MACBETH,"Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;"
5,8,2453,MACBETH,"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield"
5,8,2454,MACBETH,"To one of woman born."
5,8,2455,MACDUFF,"Despair thy charm;"
5,8,2456,MACDUFF,"And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d"
5,8,2457,MACDUFF,"Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb"
5,8,2458,MACDUFF,"Untimely ripp’d."
5,8,2459,MACBETH,"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,"
5,8,2460,MACBETH,"For it hath cow’d my better part of man!"
5,8,2461,MACBETH,"And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d,"
5,8,2462,MACBETH,"That palter with us in a double sense;"
5,8,2463,MACBETH,"That keep the word of promise to our ear,"
5,8,2464,MACBETH,"And break it to our hope!—I’ll not fight with thee."
5,8,2465,MACDUFF,"Then yield thee, coward,"
5,8,2466,MACDUFF,"And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time."
5,8,2467,MACDUFF,"We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,"
5,8,2468,MACDUFF,"Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,"
5,8,2469,MACDUFF,"“Here may you see the tyrant.”"
5,8,2470,MACBETH,"I will not yield,"
5,8,2471,MACBETH,"To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet,"
5,8,2472,MACBETH,"And to be baited with the rabble’s curse."
5,8,2473,MACBETH,"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,"
5,8,2474,MACBETH,"And thou oppos’d, being of no woman born,"
5,8,2475,MACBETH,"Yet I will try the last. Before my body"
5,8,2476,MACBETH,"I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;"
5,8,2477,MACBETH,"And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”"
5,8,2478,STAGE DIRECTION," [_Exeunt fighting. Alarums._]"
5,8,2479,STAGE DIRECTION," Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward,"
5,8,2480,STAGE DIRECTION," Ross, Thanes and Soldiers."
5,8,2481,MALCOLM,"I would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d."
5,8,2482,SIWARD,"Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,"
5,8,2483,SIWARD,"So great a day as this is cheaply bought."
5,8,2484,MALCOLM,"Macduff is missing, and your noble son."
5,8,2485,ROSS,"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt:"
5,8,2486,ROSS,"He only liv’d but till he was a man;"
5,8,2487,ROSS,"The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d"
5,8,2488,ROSS,"In the unshrinking station where he fought,"
5,8,2489,ROSS,"But like a man he died."
5,8,2490,SIWARD,"Then he is dead?"
5,8,2491,FLEANCE,"Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow"
5,8,2492,FLEANCE,"Must not be measur’d by his worth, for then"
5,8,2493,FLEANCE,"It hath no end."
5,8,2494,SIWARD,"Had he his hurts before?"
5,8,2495,ROSS,"Ay, on the front."
5,8,2496,SIWARD,"Why then, God’s soldier be he!"
5,8,2497,SIWARD,"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,"
5,8,2498,SIWARD,"I would not wish them to a fairer death:"
5,8,2499,SIWARD,"And so his knell is knoll’d."
5,8,2500,MALCOLM,"He’s worth more sorrow,"
5,8,2501,MALCOLM,"And that I’ll spend for him."
5,8,2502,SIWARD,"He’s worth no more."
5,8,2503,SIWARD,"They say he parted well and paid his score:"
5,8,2504,SIWARD,"And so, God be with him!—Here comes newer comfort."
5,8,2505,STAGE DIRECTION," Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head."
5,8,2506,MACDUFF,"Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands"
5,8,2507,MACDUFF,"Th’ usurper’s cursed head: the time is free."
5,8,2508,MACDUFF,"I see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl,"
5,8,2509,MACDUFF,"That speak my salutation in their minds;"
5,8,2510,MACDUFF,"Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,—"
5,8,2511,MACDUFF,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
5,8,2512,ALL,"Hail, King of Scotland!"

5,8,2517,MALCOLM,"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland"
5,8,2518,MALCOLM,"In such an honour nam’d. What’s more to do,"
5,8,2519,MALCOLM,"Which would be planted newly with the time,—"
5,8,2520,MALCOLM,"As calling home our exil’d friends abroad,"
5,8,2521,MALCOLM,"That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;"
5,8,2522,MALCOLM,"Producing forth the cruel ministers"
5,8,2523,MALCOLM,"Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,"
5,8,2524,MALCOLM,"Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands"
5,8,2525,MALCOLM,"Took off her life;—this, and what needful else"
5,8,2526,MALCOLM,"That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,"
5,8,2527,MALCOLM,"We will perform in measure, time, and place."
5,8,2528,MALCOLM,"So thanks to all at once, and to each one,"
